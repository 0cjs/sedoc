Microcomputer Units Sold and Market Share
=========================================

### Pre-Trinity

Apple 1 (1976-04-11), $666, 200 units in 1976. Price later dropped to $475,
sold through 1977-07, officially discontinued 1977-10.

### Trinity

TRS-80, Apple II, Pet.

In 1979 VisiCalc, the first spreadsheet, appeared. Dan Bricklin wrote it
for the Apple II becuase that's what he happened to have available; thus
bit of luck for Apple entirely changed its fortunes.

From the above chart [[reim09]], and adding in further information from
[Wikipedia][wp], we can calculate market shares (thousands of units, same
as above chart) for the major North American 1975-1983 competitors. Note
that this leaves out the large Japanese market, with some figures there
mentioned in [`timeline`](timeline.md).
