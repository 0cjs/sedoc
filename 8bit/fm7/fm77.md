Fujitsu FM-77 Notes
===================

Model information/differences from:
- [en Wikipedia][we-fm7] and [jp Wikipedia][wj-fm77] pages.
- [番外編７：FM-8/7/77/77AVシリーズの微妙な非互換性][haserin]. Massive tech
  info, including peripheral information and pinouts for all FM-7/77
  models.

The successors to the FM-7 and FM-NEW7; the FM-77 was released at the
same time as the FM-NEW7. All have separate keyboard and use 3.5"
floppy drives.

From early on there were two 400-line graphics options. Only the
FM-77L4 and FM77AV40s came with this as standard.
- MB28121 400-line set: graphics card, 192KB RAM card, F-BASIC V3.5,
  FM-JWP/77 Japanese word processor.
- MB28122 400-line set II:, graphics card, 64KB RAM card, F-BASIC V3.5.

Early models. Some have -D1 and -D2 FDD variants.

- (1984-05) FM-77D1, D2: Single- and dual-drive versions.
- (1985-02) FM-77L4: 2nd gen FDD, MB28122 400-line set.
- (1985-05) FM-77L2: Included FM sound card.

AV models lose the hyphen. Early ones have -1 and -2 FDD variants. Video
out is EIAJ-21 (JP-21) except for SX. All models have the YM2203 FM sound
chip on the motherboard, as well as the legacy AY-3-8910 PSG.

- (1985-10) FM77AV: 128 KB (max 192?), VRAM 96 KB.
  320x200/4096, 640x200/8. 320 KB FDDs.
  YM2203 sound chip in addition to SSG; simultaneous output.
- (1986) FM77AV20: 640 KB FDDs.
- (1986) FM77AV40: 192 KB (max 448), VRAM 144 KB. 320x200/262144, 640×400/8.
- (1987) FM77AV20EX: 128 (max 192) KB. No CMT.
- (1987) FM77AV40EX: 192 (max 448) KB. VRAM 192 KB. 640×400/8.
- (1988-11) FM77AV40SX: Adds video digitizing/superimposing (built-in
  FM77-414). Video out is DB-25. Upscan to 24 KHz official. No CMT.

### Graphics Modes

From [haserin09], which also has VRAM memory maps:

    Name    Res. Colors Screens
    Type C  640×200 8     1     FM-7 compatible
    Type A  640×200 8     2     4 screens on AV40
    Type B  320×200 4096  1     2 screens on AV40
    Type D  640×400 8     1     AV40 only; 2 screens on AV40EX/SX
    Type E  320×200 260k  1     AV40EX/SX only


Keyboard

### Connectors

According to [OldHard][oh-kb], there are three different connectors
(excluding infrared):

- FM-77AV1/2: [4P4C] modular (7.7 mm wide); you can use a
  straight-through "RJ9" telephone handset cable.
- FM77AV20/40: [6P6C] 6-pin modular (9.65 mm wide); you can use a
  standard RJ11 telephone-to-wall cable.
- FM77AV20EX/40EX/SX: 4-pin mini-DIN; an S-video cable can be used.

The modular jack systems use rollover cables with pin 1 connected to
4, 2 connected to 3, etc. (This may be because standard telephone
cables are reversed in this way?) The mini-DIN are straight though:
pin 1 to 1, 2 to 2, etc.

The protocol for all of them is the same, so conversion can be done
just by wiring connectors together. ([deskuma-110223]) However, with
infrared-capable keyboards the cable detect line must be held low to
tell it to use the wire instead of I/R.

For modular connecters here we use pin numberings with 1 starting at
the left when looking, with the tab down, into the jack or the cable
entry side of the plug. (This is consistent with Wikipedia [6P6C
numbering][6P6Cpin], but it's not clear if it's consistent with their
[4P4C numbering][4P4Cpin].)

See [the DIN document][mini-din] for standard mini-DIN-4 pinouts; the
diagram copied below appears to use that. Straight-through S-video
cables can also be used for these connections.

[haserin] gives the following table; for modular jacks the numbering
is reversed on the system unit side.

                    Keyboard Side
                    4P4C    6P6C   mini-DIN-4
    ----------------------------------------
    Vcc (+5V)         1       1        1
    Cable Detect      2       2
    Data              3       3        3
    GND/Signal GND    4      4,5      2,4
    Frame GND                 6        -

[deskuma-110223] gives the following pinout and diagram for the
mini-DIN-4 port; this is (XXX check) looking into the jack on the
keyboard or system unit.

    1   VCC (TTL +5 V)          /¯¯¯U¯¯¯\
    2   GND (power)            |  4   3  |
    3   KSDATA                 | 2     1 |
    4   GND (signal)            \_|■■■|_/

### Protocol

Deskuma did some reverse-engineering work on the protocol, documented
at [deskuma-110423] and [deskuma-110425].

`KSDATA` is high when no key is being pressed. A keypress generates a
40-bit serial packet at about 10 Kbps; this repeats every 20 ms until
the key is released. While holding a key, pressing a second key
changes the packet while the new key is held down; releasing it stops
transmission until the original key is released, at which point
another packet is transmitted.

The [decoding table][deskuma-110425] Deskuma made is along the lines of
the following; this is for "FULL_1" (on the number row):

         KSDATA raw  B4CCCCCB4B  1011.0100.1100.1100.1100.1100.1100.1011.0100.1011
    10,01=1 00,11=0  A002A       1010.0000.0000.0010.1010
       10=1    00=0  307         11.0000.0111

and this for backspace:

         KSDATA raw  B4CCCB3333  1011.0100.1100.1100.1100.1011.0011.0011.0011.0011
    10,01=1 00,11=0  A0200       1010.0000.0010.0000.0000
       10=1    00=0  310         11.0001.0000

### Adapters

PS2 keyboard → FM77 system unit adapters have been made by
[flexonsbd], [TheRogue], and others.

### Keyswitches

See Desk Authority Wiki [Fujitsu Leaf Spring][da fls] page.


Joystick
--------

Per [deskuma-110217], 1-5 across the top and 6-9 across the bottom, both
left to right and presumably looking into the connector:

    1:↑  2:↓  3:←    4:→   5:Vcc        A = trigger A
      6:A  7:B  8:COM  9:GND            B = trigger B

All inputs are high=OFF (3k pull-up), L=ON.

### FM-77

"CRT" DE-9F is the built-in 200-line video system on the motherboard,
providing DRGB and grayscale CVBS.

      DE-9F     1=opt12V    3=red       6=clkint    8=hsync-
    5 4 3 2 1   2=GND       4=green     7=CVBS      9=vsync-
     9 8 7 6                5=blue     (greyscale)

#### 400-line board DE-9F

The FM-77L4 model includes a 400-line board set with its own, separate
DE-9F connector, which does __NOT__ have the same pinout:

      DE-9F     1=red       4=GND       6=vsync-    8=???
    5 4 3 2 1   2=green     5=0lev      7=hsync-    9=0lev
     9 8 7 6    3=blue

- all levels TTL 0V/5V except maybe pin 8
- 123=colors confident but not totally confirmed
- 4=GND confirmed continuous w/shell
- 5,9: 0 V but not continuous w/ground
- 8=???: 2.5V positive going signal w/perhaps base at 0.5V and negative
  going long pulses on frames. Composite?

### FM77AV

#### "RGB(8P)" DE-9F

Same as FM-77 "CRT" DE-9F above.

#### "RGBマルチ" JP-21 (RGB-21)

See [conn/video](../conn/video.md) for complete information on generic
JP-21 connectors.

Output checks on my FM77AV with a cable unconnected at the external end,
except to the 'scope, or with RGB and sync connected to a monitor:

    10          composite sync
    11          +5 V (av control high?)
    12          GND or no output (Ym RGB mask)
    14          ground
    16          +3.4 V (Ys RGB direction)
    15,19,20    RGB

RGB appears to function as output with all input signals left floating.

The JP-21 might also handle the video input for the FM77AV; the keyboard
has "PC/overlay/TV" markings above PF8-12.

### FM77AV40SX

The FM77AV40SX only uses a [25-pin analog video pinout][deskuma-110215].
This is not completely verified. The pins I think are left to right,
upper than lower as one faces the port on the computer.

     1  AL_OUT      Audio out left
     2  AL_OUT_GND
     3  AR_OUT      Audio out right
     4  AR_OUT_GND
     5  CV_OUT      Composite video (not verified)
     6  CV_OUT_GND
     7  SYNC_H      Horizontal sync
     8  ?           unknown; may be Ym or Ys
     9  GND
    10  ?           unknown; may be Ym or Ys
    11  GND
    12  RGB_B_OUT   Analog blue
    13  RGB_B_GND
    14  AL_IN       Audio input left
    15  AL_IN_GND
    16  AR_IN       Audio input right
    17  AR_IN_GND
    18  CV_IN       Composite video input
    19  CV_IN_GND
    20  SYNC_V      Vertical sync
    21  VCC(AVC)    +5 V output (AV Control)
    22  RGB_R_OUT   Analog red
    23  RGB_R_GND
    24  RGB_G_OUT   Analog green
    25  RGB_G_GND


Cassette (CMT)
--------------

All models except the AV40SX have a CMT interface. However, the AV40SX
does have pads for the Fujitsu MB43413 chip (DIP-14), which hooks into
the printer controller somehow, and mini-DIN-5 socket needed for the
interface. [TheRogue on assemblergames][therogue] got this working and
provides all the details.


Floppy Drives
-------------

See [`floppy.md`](floppy.md).
