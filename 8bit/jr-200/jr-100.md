### Power

From a pic in my collection, the AC Adapter JR-A01 shows what is presumably
looking into the male DIN-4 PSU plug if the pin numbering is standard:

                            ∪
        DC +7.8V 680mA ───1   4─── DC +17V 130mA
           DC -8V 10mA ────2 3──── GROUND

There are two fuses on the motherboard [which may be blown][yakyu-ken] on
used systems. There appears to be two voltage regulators, the largest and
most heatsunk a 2DS858, and a 7812.
