National/Panasonic JR-100
=========================

Predecessor to the JR-200. Released 1981-11.

- B/W (inverse char cell available)
- 32×24 text. 128 chars plus 32 user-definable PCG chars.
  - Sticks 2-5 are standard ASCII punctuation, numbers and caps,
    except `\` replaced with `¥`.
  - Sticks 6-7 and screen code sticks 0-1 replaced by graphical chars.
    With inverted versions of these gives full 4×4 box sub-chars.
  - PCG chars typically used for katakana or lower-case.
- CPU: Fujitsu MB8861 CPU, 6800-compatible.
- 16K RAM, 8K ROM.
- Pizo speaker. Buzzer sounds (square wave from 6522 timer), "same as PC-8001."
- No joystick ports.
- External PSU.

- JR-U02 拡張ウニット (expansion unit)
  - Sits under JR-100, same width/depth, about 3 cm high.
  - Front: DE-9M joystick port
  - Back:
    - DIN-? AC Adapter
    - IDC 2×16?, can't read purpose
    - Expansion connector cable from JR-100 (short IDC ribbon cable)
    - IDX 2×17 printer
    - Reset button

Power
-----

There are two fuses on the motherboard [which may be blown][yakyu-ken] on
used systems. There appears to be two voltage regulators, the largest and
most heatsunk a 2DS858, and a 7812.

From a pic in my collection, the AC Adapter JR-A01 shows what is presumably
looking into the male DIN-4 PSU plug if the pin numbering is standard:

                            ∪
        DC +7.8V 680mA ───1   4─── DC +17V 130mA
           DC -8V 10mA ────2 3──── GROUND

Looking into jack (confirmed w/continuity checks):

                            ∪
               7812 p1 ───1   4─── 2SD858 p2
          7812 p2  GND ────2 3──── R6 RHS

- 7812: 1=in, 2=GND, 3=+12V
- 2SD858: 1=?, 2=in, 3=+5V  (pin 1 is not ground!)
- R6: LHS=-5V rail; RHS=Power connector p3

#### Alternate External PSU

Mean Well 4-rail using -5 as common (do not connect to AC ground):

    standard:  +12   +5  GND   -5   -12
         alt:  +17  +10   +5  GND    -7

Tested with
    -5 ↔ +5     10 V  100 Ω  0.10 A  1.0 W
    -5 ↔ +12    17 V  100 Ω  0.17 A  2.9 W
    -5 ↔ -12    -7 V  100 M  0.07 A  0.5 W

BUT! -5V rail spec'd to sink only 0.5 A, but computer sinks 0.82 A to its
ground. Hmmm.
