Case Screws
-----------

The bottom of the case is held on with six long screws of three different
lengths, 39, 45 and 52 mm:


           52    52

    45   LABEL        45

           39    39


Power
-----

5-pin DIN:

    1   14 VAC, 1 A (from transformer)
    2   19.8 VDC, 350 mA
    3   14 VAC, 1 A (from transformer)
    4   GND
    5   n/c

N.B. My own Model I (modified) does not use this! It's been internally
changed to use a custom external PSU providing +5/+12/-5 VDC.


Keyboard
--------

The Japanese keyboard replaces the wide `Enter` key with two
regular-size keys and remaps as follows:

    Row     US              JP
    top     :*   -=         -=, ¥
    2nd     ←    →          Enter  ←
    3rd     Enter  Clear    :*  Clear  →
    bottom  Right-Shift     英数/カナ
