Japanese Model
--------------

The Japanese Model adds additional ROM (12K→14K), replaces the character
generator with a katakana version (this does not affect graphics, I think),
and changes the keyboard.

The Japanese keyboard replaces the wide `Enter` key with two
regular-size keys and remaps as follows:

    Row     US              JP
    top     :*   -=         -=, ¥
    2nd     ←    →          Enter  ←
    3rd     Enter  Clear    :*  Clear  →
    bottom  Right-Shift     英数/カナ


Hardware
--------

### Case Screws

The bottom of the case is held on with six long screws of three different
lengths, 39, 45 and 52 mm:

           52    52
    45   LABEL        45
           39    39

### Power Input

External PSU to DIN-5 is:

    1   14 VAC, 1 A (from transformer)
    2   19.8 VDC, 350 mA
    3   14 VAC, 1 A (from transformer)
    4   GND
    5   n/c

All further regulation is done on-board.

N.B. My own Model I (modified) does not use this! It's been internally
changed to use a custom external PSU (through the same DIN-5 connector)
providing +5/+12/-5 VDC.

### Video Output, 5-pin DIN

    1   5 VDC (30 mA max.)
    4   Composite video
    5   GND

### Cassette (CMT), 5-pin DIN

    1   Motor Relay
    2   GND
    3   Motor Relay
    4   Cassette In (to earphone jack on recorder)
    5   Cassette Out (to mic. jack on player)

### Expansion connector
