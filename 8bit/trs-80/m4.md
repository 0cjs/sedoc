Display
-------

The video display is generated by the Motorola SC80765P, which is actually
the mask ID for a 6835 with specific programming. The 6835 is the same as a
6845 except that R0-R11 are read-only from ROM, with one of two twelve byte
programmed sets of values read based on the input on pin 3. (VCF Forums,
[Motorola 6845 Programmable?][vcf 38641].)

If replaced with a generic 6845, that must be initialised with code on the
boot floppy. (TRSDOS 6 and LS-DOS 6 apparently already do this programming,
in case you're using a 6845.) the pre-programmed values can be found in VCF
thread [TRS-80 Model 4 68045 CRTC Initialize - help request][vcf 63942]
