Hitachi Basic Master Machine Language Monitor
=============================================

Enter using `MON` or `MONITOR` at BASIC prompt.

- Enter aborts the current command, even if you've typed something.
- Space enters the current input, or keeps the default value if you've
  entered nothing.
- DEL clears and restarts input for the current value.
- During digit entry (for an address or value), an invalid digit will
  print a `?` after the invalid character; at this point you can type
  DEL to clear the entire value or Enter to abort the command.

Many commands start their own input mode. The commands are described in
detail in [ยง4.2 p.125 P.131].

    E   Escape (jumps to BASIC; cold start with any current program deleted)
        (On MB-6885, use `G B000` to preserve existing BASIC program.)

    R   Register display/change
    D   Display 128 bytes of memory
    M   Modify memory (can also view byte-by-byte; seems to confirm writes)
    F   Fill memory
    T   Transfer (copy) memory

    G   Go (seems to be a trace command or something like that?)
    B   create breakpoint
    S   Step

    L   Load from tape (always loads at start addr specified in file)
    P   Punch to tape (saves start addr to end - 1)
    V   Verify tape (compares memory using start addr and len in file)

    Undocumented commands:
    J   Start tape and send sound to it

Tape loads and verifies must specify the correct filename; terminate
filename input with a space or return if the filename is less than 6
characters (the remainder of the filename will be space-filled). Blocks
from other files will be ignored (though the name will be printed for each
block). See "CMT Load and Filenames" in [README](README.md) for more
details.
