Hitachi Basic Master Machine Language Monitor
=============================================

Enter using `MON` or `MONITOR` at BASIC prompt.

Enter aborts the current command, even if you've typed something.
Space enters the current input, or keeps the default value if you've
entered nothing. Many commands start their own input mode.

    E   Escape (jumps to BASIC; cold start)

    R   Register display/change
    D   Display 128 bytes of memory
    M   edit Memory (can also view byte-by-byte; seems to confirm writes)
    F   Fill memory
    T   Transfer (copy) memory

    G   Go (seems to be a trace command or something like that?)
    B   create breakpoint
    S   Step

    L   Load from tape
    P   Punch to tape
    V   Verify tape
