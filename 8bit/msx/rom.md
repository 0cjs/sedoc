MSX ROM
=======

#### Interrupts

NMI is unused by the ROM, but a RAM hook is provided. It cannot be used
under MSX-DOS because the entry vector $66 is used for DOS FCB data.

INT can be generated by cartridges and the VDP. ROM configures the VDP to
supply 60 Hz interrupts (50 Hz on PAL systems). Keyboard scan is part of
this interrupt processing.
