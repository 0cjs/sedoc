Usage Notes
-----------

### Startup

- Holding down `Shift` during the post-reset initialization sequence will
  avoid loading DOS, generally leaving with you with about 5384 more bytes
  of memory available to BASIC (around 28K instead of 23K).
- Holding down `Ctrl` will enable only one drive and leave you with about
  1558 bytes of free memory available to BASIC (around 25K instead of 23K).
