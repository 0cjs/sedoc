DIP Switches and Jumpers
------------------------

### PC-8801mkIIFR

From PC-8801mkIIFR User Guide (some scans in my retrodocs).
Switches marked "N88B" active in N₈₈BASIC mode only.

SW1 (p.17); standard settings 01011.00000:
- 1 (N88B): ON=terminal mode, OFF=BASIC mode
- 2 (N88B): ON=80 column, OFF=40 column
- 3 (N88B): ON=25 row, OFF=20 row (also see 注１)
- 4: S Parameter: ON, OFF
- 5: DEL code: ON=処理 (process), OFF=無理
- 6: Memory wait: ON=memory read cycle 1 wait state
- 7: CMD SINGの？止: ON=functionality off, OFF=functionality on
- 8: CRT mode: ON=専用display (24.8 kHz), OFF=15.7 kHz
- 9: mkIISR Slot bus signalling compatibility: ON=1,2, OFF=3
  (注2: must be off if using 8" floppy drives)
- 10: unused

SW2 (p.18); standard settings 0110.0010:
- 1: Parity check: ON, OFF
- 2: Parity: even/odd?
- 3: Data bit length: ON=8, OFF=7
- 4: Stop bits: ON=2, OFF=1
- 5: X parameter: ON, OFF
- 6: Communications ???: ON=half, OFF=full
- 7: 5"FDDよreboot: ON=boot, OFF=no boot (off on model 10, on for 20, 30)
- 8: Internal FDD interface disable: ON=disable, OFF=enable

Slide switches:
- Speed mode: S (left)=normal?, H (right)=high
- BASIC mode: V1 (left), V2 (right)

CRT Clock jumpers:
- For both, 1 (left)=normal?, 2 (right)=external clock. Looks like both
  should always be set to 1.

RS-232C baud rate jumpers (looks like jumper only one):
- 1:75, 2:150, 3:300, 4:600, 5:1200, 6:2400, 7:4800, 8:9600, 9:19200

### PC-8801mkII

- Outputs: "B/W" DIN-5, "COLOR" DIN-8; usual pinouts.
- Jumpers under front panel door:
  - `S`,`H`: Probably standard 15 kHz and high 24 kHz resolution.
  - `M`,`T`: ???
  - At `S`,`M` jumpered, monochrome output works on PVM (80 col mode).

### PC-8801mkIIFR

- Outputs:
  - Analog RGB DA-15, PC-98 pinout
  - Digital RGB DIN-8, prob. standard pinout
- Jumpers under front panel door for "CRT Clock:
  -  Left: `1`,`2`: ???
  - Right: `1`,`2`: ???

Note that SW1.8 controls output freqency on the analogue RGB output
(confirmed) and probably the DRGB output, too. ON=24.8 kHz; OFF=15.7 kHz


Keyboard
--------

### PC-8801mkII

- Computer side is a 13-pin DIN-like connector: 3×4, 1×1. Female jack on
  computer, male plug on keyboard cable.
- Keyboard PCB connector is 2r×8 .1" shrouded header. See below for wire
  colours.

Odd 13-pin DIN-like connector. Only chip is a [74159][SN74159]
4→16 decoder/demux.

Pin Mapping. Colours with slashes after their names have a black stripe.
This is a trace-out of my broken PC-8001mkII keyboard, so some things that
look odd are probably the breakage.
