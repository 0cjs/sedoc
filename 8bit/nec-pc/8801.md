NEC PC-8801 Series
==================

Page references below are to the PC-8801mkIIFR User Guide (some scans in my
retrodocs).

There were several modes for running software in an attempt to maintain
compatibility across parts of the model line. The summary is below; various
sections give more specifics regarding video, etc.:

- __N mode__ was backwards compatibility with the PC-8001; it was available
  only on the PC-8801, mkII, mkIISR and mkIITR (not on FR or MR).
- __V1 mode__ was available on all models. V2 games will error out or beep.
- __V2 mode__ introduced on __R__ series; avilable on all models after.
  V1 games will usually have glitches, washed out bluish-green screen.
- __V3 mode__ available only on __V__ models.


Models
------

The model lists on Wikipeida provide complementary information in the
[Japanese][models-ja] and [English][models-en] versions; the [Neo Kobe
archive][neo-kobe] also has a list and some instructions for running
software on various machines. See "Video" below for graphics information.

The mkII SR is generally considered the "base model"; later models should
all have compatibility with mkII SR software (but not software using mkII
SR backward compatibility such as N mode). New hardware introduced in later
models (e.g., new sound chips) is almost invariably made available as
expansion boards that will work in the mkII SR.

The first letter of the suffix roughly indicates: __S__: standard model
with more backwards compatibility; __T__: includes modem; __F__:
cost-reduced; __M__: 192 KB RAM, 2HD floppies; __V__: 8086 support. The
mkII, SR, FR and FH had model10/20/30 versions with 0/1/2 FDDs installed.

64 KB RAM was standard. A bank-switched 128 KB (bringing total to 192 KB)
expansion board was available; the M models had this built-in. V models had
512 KB. The bank switch design supported up to 512 KB and there were
third-party expansion boards with up to 2 MB.

Initial versions:
- __PC-8801__ (1981-11): No internal drive bays. Kanji ROM optional.

### PC-8801mkII

- Outputs: "B/W" DIN-5, "COLOR" DIN-8; usual pinouts.
- Jumpers under front panel door:
  - `S`,`H`: Probably standard 15 kHz and high 24 kHz resolution.
  - `M`,`T`: ???
  - At `S`,`M` jumpered, monochrome output works on PVM (80 col mode).

### PC-8801mkIIFR

- Outputs:
  - Analog RGB DA-15, PC-98 pinout
  - Digital RGB DIN-8, prob. standard pinout
- Jumpers under front panel door for "CRT Clock:

Note that SW1.8 controls output freqency on the analogue RGB output
(confirmed) and probably the DRGB output, too. ON=24.8 kHz; OFF=15.7 kHz

All pins are outputs. DRGB DIN-8 is pretty [standard][din]:

Keyboard
--------

### PC-8801mkII

- Computer side is a 13-pin DIN connector: 3×4, 1×1. Female jack on
  computer, male plug on keyboard cable. This is still commonly available
  (it was used for a Kenwood receiver), though not cheap, and may be the
  same as Atari ST color video.
- Keyboard PCB connector is 2r×8 .1" shrouded header. See below for wire
  colors.

Odd 13-pin DIN-like connector. Only chip is a [74159][SN74159]
4→16 decoder/demux (the open-collector output version of the '154).

The keyswitches have one pin at the top and two at the bottom.
- The bottom right (looking from the front of the key) is the switched pin,
  and are the row input of the matrix, connected to the row signal ($0-$A)
  from the '159. (XXX always row output for all keys?)
- Top and bottom left are shorted, both being the other side of the switch,
  and are connected to the column output of the matrix.

### Keyboard Matrix

The matrix is as follows, rows (pulled low by '159) at left; columns across
the top. Rows C and D do not exist on the mkII keyboard; the later
keyboards return that code and an emulated shift+key pair of codes for
older software.

and has RS-232C I/O port information.

- 8: Internal FDD interface disable: ON=disable, OFF=enable

Slide switches:
- Speed mode: S (left)=early standard (4 Mhz), H (right)=high (8 MHz)
- BASIC mode: V1 (left), V2 (right)

CRT Clock jumpers:
- For both, 1 (left)=normal, 2 (right)=external clock.
  Looks like both should always be set to 1.

RS-232C baud rate jumpers (looks like jumper only one):
- 1:75, 2:150, 3:300, 4:600, 5:1200, 6:2400, 7:4800, 8:9600, 9:19200
