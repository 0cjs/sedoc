NEC PC-9801 Series
==================

(Yes, actually 16-bit, not 8-bit, but still a NEC retro-PC.)

- 8086 (V30), '286 and '386/'486 machines.
- Through about '94 most games required no more than '286
- Older systems can include both switches and [configuration in
  battery-backed CMOS RAM][cmos]:

Popular Models:
- VM, UV: V30 (8086)

    - etc.

Graphics Systems [col graphics]:
- Text: always a separate μPD7220 with 8 KB (later 12 KB) RAM
- GDC: Second μPD7220 96K
- GC (GRCG): Graphic Charger accel 192K
- EGC: Enhanced Graphic Charger accel 256-512K

3.5" HD diskettes use a 300 RPM 1.2 MB format (1K sectors!) until very late.
The PC-9821 series introduced the PC-standard 1.44 MB format.

### Random Notes

- Marimo includes a `Conv98AT` program that can tweak a PC-98 format HDD so
  that it can be read by an AT-compatible machine. This must be used
  _before_ plugging the disk into the AT or the AT will corrupt the PC-98
  disk.


Floppy Drives and VFOs
----------------------

The NEC N5200 (1981-07) used 8" drives and the similar PC-9801 (1982-10)
supported 8" and 5.25" drives (including PC-88 peripherals). Rather than
switching with Shugart to the new 5.25" interface, they instead adopted
a 5.25" interface similar to the 8" one, and continued with this even
through to 3.5" drives. The primary differences from the standard
5.25"/3.5" interfaces were:
- 77-track 1.2 MB format for HD drives (both 5.25" and 3.5"), and
- external data separator (called a "VFO," via synecdoche) on the drive
  itself and, later, sometimes as a board in the drive chassis. These
  use 16.00 MHz (2HD) and 19.20 MHz (2DD) oscillators.

Thus NEC 5.25" and 3.5" drives use a [50-pin external interface][f50p],
usually on mini-ribbon, that is more reminiscent of an 8" 50-pin edge
connector than the standard 5.25" interface.
- _Adds_ `WINDOW` clock signal from data separator (present in Shugart 8"
  interface, not in 5.25" interface)
- _Changes_ `DATA` from head output (as it was in 5.25") to data separator
  output, and _removes_ head output (present in 8"). However, possibly
  `DATA` can be changed to head output for computers with onboard VFO.
- _Removes_ density select (pin 2 on modern 34-pin interface)

### NEC Pinouts

- Diagrams:
  - [PC-9801 External Floppy Drive connector pinout][f50p],
  - [VFOありFDDの外付け化][98epj-ex] (.1" header numbered wrong side)
- 50-pin micro-ribbon: looking into the female connector on the chassis,
  pins are numbered left to right 25-1 across the top and 50-26 across the
  bottom.
- 34-pin dual-row .1" header or edge connector: pin 1 on bottom, 2 above it
  on top, etc. Edge connector has slot between pins 3/4 and 5/6. .1" header
  has tab at top.
- `Read Data` is the separated data, not the head data.

### Specific Drive Systems

"Drive system" describes a case that includes drives, PSU and possibly a
stand-alone VFO board. Otherwise these sections describe bare drives.

#### NEC FD1155C and FD1155D 5.25" Drives

[NEC FD1155D(5.25インチFDD)][FD1155D] describes the drives in some detail,
including specs, caps and jumper settings. The 'C' model has no on-board
VFO; the 'D' model has one. For NEC 2HD mode they run at 360 RPM; all D/DD
modes run at 300 RPM. (XXX confirm this; I've heard other things too.)

Jumper/switch settings:

    SW      PC98    IBM     Description
    RD      2       1       1=disable VFO (data separator); 2=enable
    USE     1       2       1=head load; 2=in use
    MON     1       1       motor control: 1=motor on; 2=head load; 3=drive sel
    DX      0/1     1/1     drive number
    VCs                     terminating resistors: signal lines
    VS                      terminating resistors: DS0-3 lines
    DCG     1       2       pin 34: 1=ready; 2=disk change
    HDE     1       1       1=360 RPM; 2=300 RPM (XXX must be wrong?)
    DEN     1       1       1=mode switch; 2=DD; 3=HD

Late PC98 models may have VFO (e.g. μPD71065G) on motherboard; if so,
disable VFO on drive.

It also includes a list of many other NEC drives with a bit of information
on each:
- 8": FD1160 (2D 1.2 MB), FD1164 (1D .6 MB slimline),
  FD1165 (2D 1.2 MB slimline)
- 5.25" 2D: FD1053, FD1054
- 5.25" 2DD: FD1055, FD1057
- 5.25" 2HD: FD1155
- 5.25" 2HD/2DD: FD1155B, FD1155C, FD1157C, FD1158C
- 5.25" 2HD/2DD VFO: FD1155D, FD1157D, FD1158D
- 3.5" 1D: FD1034
- 3.5" 2D: FD1035, FD1036, FD1037
- 3.5" 1.2M/2DD: FD1135, FD1136
- 3.5" 2HD/1.2M/2DD: FD1137, FD1138, FD1139, FD1148, FD1231, FD1238

#### Elecom 2HD/2DD FDD-5W Drive System

The Elecom 2HD/2DD FDD-5W uses standard drives and a separate board with
drive select logic and a [SED9421C0B] data separator:

                     ┌──∪──┐
                OSC1 │1  18│ Vdd (+5V)
                OSC2 │2  17│ NC
      (uPD765) CLK1† │3  16│ NC
                 N/C │4  15│ CLK2 (Clock for FD179x)
     (drive) RD DATA │5  14│ WCLK
       (sep)  WINDOW │6  13│ LPF
       (sep)    DATA │7  12│ OFFSET
             MFM/nFM │8  11│ CONTROL
            MIN/nSTD │9  10│ Vss (GND)
                     └─────┘

DIP switch array (up=open, down=close):

     1   2   3   4   5      switch number
    13  12  11  10          50P micro-ribbon
    DS3 DS2 DS1 DS0          "       "

SW1-4 determine drive numbers/select signal response:

    ON  ON  OFF OFF         drives 1,2 (select 0,1)
    OFF OFF ON  ON          drives 3,4 (select 2,3)
                    OFF     drive unit does not work
                    ON      drives work

SW5:
- Down/closed: grounds pin 2 on connector to FDDs
- Up/open: +5V 2k2 pull-up brings pin 2 high
- Somehow open is used for normal HD operation? Empirically, open worked
  w/2HD diskettes and closed did not.
