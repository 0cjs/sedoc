Page references below are to the PC-8801mkIIFR User Guide (some scans in my
retrodocs).

There were several modes for running software in an attempt to maintain
compatibility across parts of the model line. The summary is below; various
sections give more specifics regarding video, etc.:

- __N mode__ was backwards compatibility with the PC-8001; it was available
  only on the PC-8801, mkII, mkIISR and mkIITR (not on FR or MR).
- __V1 mode__ was available on all models. V2 games will error out or beep.
- __V2 mode__ introduced on __R__ series; avilable on all models after.
  V1 games will usually have glitches, washed out bluish-green screen.
- __V3 mode__ available only on __V__ models.


Models
------

The model lists on Wikipeida provide complementary information in the
[Japanese][models-ja] and [English][models-en] versions; the [Neo Kobe
archive][neo-kobe] also has a list and some instructions for running
software on various machines. [[rcp88spc]] has specs. See "Video" below for
graphics information.

The mkII SR is generally considered the "base model"; later models should
all have compatibility with mkII SR software (but not software using mkII
SR backward compatibility such as N mode). New hardware introduced in later
models (e.g., new sound chips) is almost invariably made available as
expansion boards that will work in the mkII SR.

The first letter of the suffix roughly indicates: __S__: standard model
with more backwards compatibility; __T__: includes modem; __F__:
cost-reduced; __M__: 192 KB RAM, 2HD floppies; __V__: 8086 support. The
mkII, SR, FR and FH had model10/20/30 versions with 0/1/2 FDDs installed.

64 KB RAM was standard. A bank-switched 128 KB (bringing total to 192 KB)
expansion board was available; the M models had this built-in. V models had
512 KB. The bank switch design supported up to 512 KB and there were
third-party expansion boards with up to 2 MB.

Standard peripheral ports include:
- Video
  - B/W CVBS: DIN-5F ([standard pinout](../conn/din.md))
  - Digital RGB: DIN-8 female
  - Analog RGB: DA-15 male (V2 mode only)
- CMT: 8-pin 270° DIN female jack (early units only)
- RS-232: DB-25 female; NEC D8251C UART/USART
- Printer: 14-pin micro-ribbon
- Reader or I/O (GPIO) for joysticks, mouse: DE-9 male (not on 8801?)
- Expansion slots (4 on original model; 1 or 3 all others).

It's often the case that motherboards will have unpopulated pads for
missing features, such as for the CMT port on xM models.

Initial versions:
- __PC-8801__ (1981-11): No internal drive bays. Kanji ROM optional in
  motherboard sockets. Buzzer sound only. 4 slots (more than any other

- Original PC-8001 graphics was 160×100×8; not clear how this relates to
  N mode. There was a separate high-resolution adapter FGU8200 and
  user-defined character generator (PCG8100).
- __N mode__ (DIN-5) was backwards compatibility with the PC-8001; it was
  dropped after the SR (not available on R-series F or M models).
- __V1 mode__ (DIN-8) was available on all models.
- __V2 mode__ (DA-25) introduced on __R__ series and avilable on all models
  after that.
- __V3 mode__ available only on __V__ models.

### PC-8801mkII

- Outputs: "B/W" DIN-5, "COLOR" DIN-8; usual pinouts.
- Jumpers under front panel door:
  - `S`,`H`: Probably standard 15.7 kHz and high 24.8 kHz resolution.
  - `M`,`T`: ???
  - At `S`,`M` jumpered, monochrome output works on PVM (80 col mode).

### PC-8801mkIIxR

- Outputs (all 75Ω):
  - Analog RGB DA-15F (see [conn/video#DA-15]).
  - B/W DIN-5 (not on FR): 1=12V 2=GND 3=CVBS 4=NC? 5=NC?
  - Digital RGB DIN-8, [standard pinout][din]
    - Pin 1: +12 V
    - Pin 3: Color clock (14.3183 MHz in both modes)
- Jumpers under front panel door for "CRT Clock:
  -  Left: `1`,`2`: ???
  - Right: `1`,`2`: ???

SW1.8 output frequency (ON=24.8 kHz; OFF=15.7 kHz) confirmed to control
all three ouputs (RGB DA-15, DRGB DIN-8 DRGB, B/W DIN-5).


Keyboard
--------

### PC-8801mkII

- Computer side is a 13-pin DIN connector: 3×4, 1×1. Female jack on
  computer, male plug on keyboard cable. This is still commonly available
  (it was used for a Kenwood receiver), though not cheap, and may be the
  same as Atari ST color video.
- Keyboard PCB connector is 8×2 .1" shrouded header. See below for wire
  colors.

Odd 13-pin DIN-like connector. Only chip is a [74159][SN74159]
4→16 decoder/demux (the open-collector output version of the '154).

The keyswitches have one pin at the top and two at the bottom.
- The bottom right (looking from the front of the key) is the switched pin,
  and are the row input of the matrix, connected to the row signal ($0-$A)
  from the '159. (XXX always row output for all keys?)
- Top and bottom left are shorted, both being the other side of the switch,
  and are connected to the column output of the matrix.

### Keyboard Matrix

The matrix is as follows, rows (pulled low by '159) at left; columns across
the top. Rows C and D do not exist on the mkII keyboard; the later
keyboards return that code and an emulated shift+key pair of codes for
older software.

Floppy Drives (FDD)
-------------------

The 8801 MH drives seem to be unusual in having a "2D/2DD" (double-step)
select on pin 4. This, among perhaps other things, means that the drive
when moved to a PC-88VA2 won't boot a DD diskette. (The PC-88VA2 is also
weird in runing DD diskettes at 360 instead of 300 RPM.) [[framgate]]


Development Information
-----------------------

- The Z88DK project [issue #996][z88dk #996] discusses some PC-8801
  technical information, includes links to other resources, mentions how to
  page RAM, and has RS-232C I/O port information.
- youkan [PC-8801 覚え書き][yk] has memory map/banking/IO/much more.
- [[rcp88io]] for a list of I/O ports


DIP Switches and Jumpers
------------------------

References:
- [PC-8801/mkII/SR/TR/FR/MRのディップスイッチ][ohta dip]. DIP switch
  reference page including factory settings for plain/mkII/xR models. This
  appears to offer no more information than the user manual. Other pages on
  this site include some periperhal, software and emulator information.
- youkan [PC-8801 覚え書き][yk]. A variety of useful reference information,
  including a memory map/banking scheme, I/O ports, kanji ROM, disk
  subsystem, expansion slot, DIP switches, serial mouse, post-FH keyboard
  and a 64-color graphics mod.

### PC-8801

Switches/jumpers are on back, under a clear plastic cover.

[[ohta dip]] lists only 8 switches as one bank:
- 1: 未使用 (unused)
- 2: MEMORY WAIT 1=WAIT 0=通常 (normal)
- 3-7: ユーザは使用できません
- 8: ROM選択: 1=N-BASIC, 2=N₈₀-BASIC

- SW1 1-6:
  - 1-1: BASIC 1=N-BASIC 2=N₈₈-BASIC
  - 1-2: Terminal: 1=terminal mode, 2=BASIC mode
  - 1-3: Screen width (start): 1=80 2=40
  - 1-4: Screen height (start): 1=25 2=20
  - 1-5: S-parameter: 1=on 2=off
  - 1-6: DEL code: 1=process 2=ignore
- SW2 1-6
  - 2-1: Parity: 1=present 0=absent
  - 2-2: Parity: 1=even 0=odd
  - 2-3: Data bits: 1=8 bits, 2=7 bits
  - 2-4: Stop bits: 1=2 bits, 0=1 bit
  - 2-5: X parameter: 1=on 0=off
  - 2-6: Duplex: 1=half 0=full
- JP  RS-232C 1-8,IE.
  - 1:75, 2:150, 3:300, 4:600, 5:1200, 6:2400, 7:4800, 8:9600
  - I: internal clock; E: external clock.
- JP  CRT SH×2,MT012×5.
  - S: low resolution (15 kHz)
  - H: high resolution (24 kHz)
  - M: Text + graphics 1,2,3
  - T: Text
  - 0: Graphics 1
  - 1: Graphics 2
  - 2: Graphics 3

### PC-8801mkII xR Series

Switches marked "N88" active in N₈₈BASIC mode only.

SW1 (FR p.17); standard settings 01011.00000:
- 1 (N88): ON=terminal mode, OFF=BASIC mode
- 2 (N88): ON=80 column, OFF=40 column
- 3 (N88): ON=25 row, OFF=20 row (also see 注１)
- 4: S Parameter: ON, OFF
- 5: DEL code: ON=処理 (process), OFF=無理
- 6: Memory wait: ON=memory read cycle 1 wait state
- 7: CMD SING inhibit: ON=CMD SING disabled, OFF=CMD SING enabled
- 8: CRT mode: ON=専用display (24.8 kHz), OFF=15.7 kHz
- 9: (FR/MR only) mkIISR Slot bus signalling compatibility: ON=1,2, OFF=3
  (注2: must be off if using 8" floppy drives)
- 10: (FR/MR only) unused

SW2 (FR p.18); standard settings 0110.0010:
- 1: Parity check: ON, OFF
- 2: Parity: even/odd?
- 3: Data bit length: ON=8, OFF=7
- 4: Stop bits: ON=2, OFF=1
- 5: X parameter: ON, OFF
- 6: Communications ???: ON=half, OFF=full
- 7: 5"FDDよreboot: ON=boot, OFF=no boot (off on model 10, on for 20, 30)
- 8: Internal FDD interface disable: ON=disable, OFF=enable

RS-232C baud rate jumpers (looks like jumper only one):
- 1:75, 2:150, 3:300, 4:600, 5:1200, 6:2400, 7:4800, 8:9600, 9:19200

CRT Clock jumpers (two sets of two pairs: `1 2`, `1 2`):
- For both, 1 (left)=normal, 2 (right)=external clock.
  Looks like both should always be set to pair 1.

Slide switches:
- Speed mode: S (left)="standard" (? Mhz), H (right)="high sped" (4 MHz?)
- BASIC mode:
  - SR: N80 (left), N88V1 (middle), N88V2 (right)
  - FR:             N88V1 (left),   N88V2 (right)
