ROM and BASIC
=============


Versions
--------

There are essentially six different ROM/BASIC editions, with each machine
having up to three of them. Modes are switched with a switch on the front
of the machine and indicated with a light.

    Series      Mode  Banner
    80 88        N    NEC PC-8001 BASIC Ver 1.0
    80                (? N80-BASIC ?)
    80                (? N80SR-BASIC ?)
       88        V1   NEC N-88 BASIC Version 1.x
       88        V2   NEC N-88 BASIC Version 2.x
       88        V3   NEC N-88 BASIC Version 3.x

PC-8001 BASIC v1.1 is a varaiant of Microsoft Disk BASIC 4.51,
but disk I/O is not in ROM version (I think). The copyright banners are:

    N-88 copyright banner:      Copyright (C) 198n by Microsoft
    PC-8001 copyright banner:   Copyright 1979 (C) by Microsoft

After booting a DOS/Disk BASIC, a prefix banner will be printed before the
ROM banner:

    S-DOS80 Version 2.0  for N/N80-BASIC
    Copyright 1985 (C) by S.Kobayashi

Selected version information (from [8xROM] and experimentation).
The year given next to the version is the Microsoft copyright year and
indicates that it's been verified on one of my machines.
