THE HYRULE FANTASY ゼルダの伝説 / The Legend of Zelda
-----------------------------------------------------

NES: JP 1986-02-21, NA 1987-08-22, EU 1987-11-27

Per [manual][zme]:

         A: use sword; throw sword if health is full (3 hearts)
         B: use alternate item
     START: switch main/sub screen for B weapon selection and status info
    SELECT: pause (not on Game & Watch)

General:
- "Radar" at upper left. Shows location and overworld/labyrinth maps if link
  has them. Labyrinth also has level display (leave if too high).

Combat:
- When not using sword, Link's shield blocks lower-power projectiles from
  facing direction.
- Drops from killed enemies disappear after 10 seconds

Pickups:
- Blue ruby = 5 red rubies
- Heart container = +1 heart
- Fairy = full health (released by enemy or found in spring)
- Alternate items:
  - Key, magic key: one, many uses.
  - Ladder: allows crossing pits/rivers 1 square wide
  - Raft: to cross water; can be launched only from a dock
  - Map: shows map at upper left
  - Compass: shows Triforce fragments in labyrinths
  - Letter to little old lady: `B` will show to lady who lives in cave
  - Blue, red rings: reduces damage by 50%, 75%
  - Power bracelet: extra strength, can even lift giant rocks
  - Magical clock: stops enemies moving (only on current screen)
  - Wooden boomerang: light damage/slows enemies. Magical version flies further.
  - Bomb: explodes, one use. Each pickup = 4 bombs, carry max 8.
  - Bow; wooden/silver arrow: need both to use; each arrow shot costs 1 ruby.
    Some enemies can be killed only with bow/arrows.
  - Blue, red candles: lights one, several screens
  - Whistle: mysterious magical item; use it to see what it does.
  - Enemy bait: lures some (not all) enemies (looks like bone in meat)
  - Water of life: drink to restore all health. Red = 2 sips left, blue = 1.
  - Magic wand, book. 

Eight Triforce fragments must be found. Finding one restores all health. When
all eight found, blow whistle to call whirlwind and warp to ninth labyrinth
entrance.

Hints re finding caves:
- Not only in places you can see; Link may be able to pass through previously
  unable pathways by using something else.
- "Legend has it that there are caves in every possible place above ground.
  Link is bound to find them as long as he has enough power."
