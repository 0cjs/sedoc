Retrobright / Retr0bright
=========================

Hydrogen peroxide is difficult to get in Japan. However, using just an
"active oxygen" laundry booster (TAED) alone does seem to work according to
[bokuraku.com] using just 1 part ワイドハイターEX to 2 parts water under
sunlight for a few days (maybe less in mid-day July/August sun) works well.
(Use weights and/or chopsticks and tape to keep the workpiece under the
surface.) Using a UV lamp did not work with this, however.

[Dave Farquhar][dfarq] has had some sucess with sunlight alone, given long
enough (sometimes weeks) and even LED lights, so long as the workpiece is
kept away from sunlight filtered through windows.
