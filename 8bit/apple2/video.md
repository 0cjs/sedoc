Apple II Video
==============

Character Set
-------------

As described on [pp. 14-16][a2ref 14] of the _Apple II Reference Manual_,
the Apple II character ROM has 64 characters: the two ASCII upper-case
sticks followed by the punctuation and the numbers stick. In the text
buffer the lower 6 bits determine the character code and the upper two
select flashing, inverse, normal and normal text.

The Enhanced IIe and IIc differ ([a2cref] p.360) in having two character
sets, the _primary character set_ with inverse, flashing upper- and
lower-case blocks, and the _alternate character set_ with inverse
upper-case, inverse lower-case, normal upper-case and normal lower-case
blocks.

Flashing display must not be used with enhanced video firmware active, but
only in 40-column mode with enhanced video firmware turned off.

### Mouse Text

[MouseText][] ([a2cref] p.90) is designed for use with GUI programs. The
enhanced video firmware allows printing of these via setting inverse and
mouse text mode and printing the $40-$5F ASCII sticks. From [a2cref] p.91:

Video Generation Technical Details
----------------------------------

### Video Scan

Screen scan, from [this vapor lock description][vapor]:
- 65 cycles for for each of the 192 scan lines: 40 cycles of drawing
  and 25 cycles of hblank. (65th cycle is stretched.)
- 4550 cyles of vblank (70 scan lines).
- [Sync can be found][rcse 14027] by putting an appropriate pattern
  into the frame buffer and reading the select soft switch for the
  current mode (e.g., $C051 for text mode) which will usually return
  the data most recently read by the last video read φ1 cycle.
- [mmphosis] has sample code to do this.
- The [Apple II Mouse Card][mouse] used a similar technique except that it
  had a flip-flop that would capture `D0` during Φ1; the test would read
  that to figure out a value for the 6522 timer.
