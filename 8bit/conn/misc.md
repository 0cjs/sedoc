### Ring and Spade/Y Connectors

_Ring_ connectors have a closed ring through which a screw is inserted to
connect them to a screw terminal. _Spade_ connectors (called _Y_ connectors
in Japan) are similiar, but with an open end to allow insertion into a
screw terminal without entirely removing the screw (and upper contact
plate, if present). Both are referred to as _lugs_ and have a cylindrical
area into which the bare wire end is inserted; the cylinder is then crushed
to crimp the lug and wire.

Sizing is usually based on the inside diameter of the ring or width between
the two blades of the spade. For Meanwell PSUs, 3.2 mm works well.

The PS-71NH from elpa.co.jp is ⌀3.2 mm (inside) the spade, 15.8 mm long,
and ⌀1.7 mm cylinder, appropriate for ⌀0.57–1.44 mm (0.25–1.65mm², 23–15
AWG) wire.
