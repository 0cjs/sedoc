Micro Ribbon ("Centronics") Connectors
======================================

Amphenol's [Micro Ribbon] connector, often referred to as "Centronics"
(especially with printers, standardised as [IEEE 1284]) has D-shaped casing;
- Jack: equal number of flat contacts on either side of the interior ring;
- Plug: a bar in the middle with flat contacts on top/bottom of the bar.
- Two sizes, with contact pitches of:
  - 0.085" (2.16mm): original size ("Centronics"); IEEE 1284 type B
  - 0.050" (1.27 mm): "mini-Centronics", "SCSI"; IEEE 1284 type C (also MDR36 or HPCN36

I call these:
- "MR-nn" (2.16mm): aka IEEE 1284 type B, Centronics
- "MRS-nn" (1.27mm): aka IEEE 1284 type C), MDR36, HPCN36
- IEEE 1284 includes a type A, which is DB-25.

Uses:
- MR-14: PC-88/MSX/etc. printer ports
- MR-24: IEEE 488 (GPIB, HP-IB, CBM) interface
- MR-36: IEEE 1284 parallel interface
- MR-50: RJ21X "telco" connector for multi-line telephone systems
- MR-50: SCSI-1 interface
- MRS-50: SCSI-2 interface

Wikipedia's [IEEE 1284] page has standard cable specs and wire colors.
