KF2510 / KF2540 Connectors
==========================

[KF2510][handson] is a 2.54mm wire to board crimp connector system.
- PCB mount board side is male, with a large guide sticking out beside the
  pins on one side.
- Wire side is female, with a small guide ridge at each end of one side;
  the male connector guide slides between these ridges.
- Rating: 250V 3A AC/DC
- This appears to be the one used for PC fans and 3.5" FDD power connectors.
- Refrences:
  - [[handson]], [Molex KK-254][pcboard.ca]

[KF2540][aliauto] appears to be the wire-mount male connector that mates
to the KK2510 wire-mount female connector.

There is a "3+1" version of the 4-pin connector:
- Wire side female shroud has 4 pins but the guide spacing is to fit on a
  3-pin connector (blocked by 4-pin guide).
- Wire side male shroud has 4 pins and a 3-pin size guide so that 3-pin or
  4-pin connector can plug into it.
