Apple Macintosh
===============

Mac Classic:
- Left side front button is reset; rear button is NMI, which brings up
  [MicroBug].
- Command-Option-X-O boots ROM MacOS 6.x (if held down early enough)


MicroBug
--------

Numbers are entered in hex. All expressions have an inherent size of byte,
word (16 bits) or long (32 bits) based on the number of hex digits. `.`,
registers, etc. are 4 bytes. Bad expressions do not produce an error but
instead do random stuff.Parsing is extremely "forgiving," 

- `.`: Yields "dot address." Initially 0; set by `DM` and `SM`
- `@<expr>`: Yields value of memory at _expr._
- `RAx`: Yields contents of address register _Ax._
- `RDx`: Yields contents of data register _Dx._
- `PC`: Yields contents of program counter.
- `- <expr>`: Yields _expr_ negated.
- `<expr> + <expr>`: Sum.
- `<expr> - <expr>`: Difference.

Commands:
- `DM [addr]`: Dump memory and set `.` to _addr._ Defaults to one past last
  location dumped. Typing Enter after continues dump.
- `SM addr expr...`: Set memory, set `.` to _addr_ and display dump of
  entered data. _exprs_ may be byte, word or long. Typing Enter after
  continues dump.
- `G [addr]`: Start execution at _addr._ Defaults to where MicroBug was
  entered (i.e., resume program).
- `TD`: Display all registers ("total display").
- `Ax|Dx|PC|SR [expr]`. Display or set register.

Tips and tricks:
- Force quit current process with `SM 0 A9F4G 0`. (Places an `_ExitToShell`
  trap at 0 and continues at that trap.)
- If system hangs in debugger, try turnning off your modem.
- Use MacsBug on a second Mac (running similar code?) to be able to
  disassemble code, etc.


Floppy Drives
-------------

Hold down mouse button during power-up to auto-eject floppy.

- SuperDrive (1.44MB): Sony MFD-75W-01G
- 800K drive: Sony MP-51W, MFD-51W series. Used in the 1986 Macintosh 512K
  and Plus, and the 1987 Macintosh SE.

Suggested lubrication is Molykote EM-30L (Poly-Î±-olefin, Lithium soap, PTFE
etc.) for gears and metal-on-metal contacts, and SuperLube PFTE oil for
rails and some studs. Others suggest [silicone grease][] (usually PDMS
silicone oil and amorphous fumed silica thickener).

JDW mentions that Kure 5-56 (same thing as WD-40) should _not_ be used
as a lubricant.
