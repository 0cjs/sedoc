Apple Macintosh
===============

Mac Classic:
- Command-Option-X-O boots ROM MacOS 6.x (if held down early enough)

Floppy Drives
-------------

Hold down mouse button during power-up to auto-eject floppy.

- SuperDrive (1.44MB): Sony MFD-75W-01G
- 800K drive: Sony MP-51W, MFD-51W series. Used in the 1986 Macintosh 512K
  and Plus, and the 1987 Macintosh SE.

Suggested lubrication is Molykote EM-30L (Poly-Î±-olefin, Lithium soap, PTFE
etc.) for gears and metal-on-metal contacts, and SuperLube PFTE oil for
rails and some studs. Others suggest [silicone grease][] (usually PDMS
silicone oil and amorphous fumed silica thickener).

JDW mentions that Kure 5-56 (same thing as WD-40) should _not_ be used
as a lubricant.
