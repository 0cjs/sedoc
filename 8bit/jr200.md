I/O Interfaces
--------------

### Video

RF output is just a hole in the back of my computer. Digital RGB and
composite are on a DIN-8 270°. Mapping between DIN-8 and P1308 pins
below was confirmed using the video cable that came with the machine.

    DIN-8 1308    Description
      1           vert sync + vert blank
      2   1,5,6   GND
      3           Composite video
      4     7     HSync (but broken on mine?)
      5     8     VSync
      6     2     Red
      7     3     Green
      8     4     Blue


### Misc.

CMT interface pinout is standard, as mentioned in the [OLD Hard
Connector Information][oh-c] table.

Joysticks are 2× DB-9 male jacks. Not Atari-compatible, but
MSX-compatible. Pins 1-4 and 6-7 are switch inputs, 8 is an output, 5
is +5V and 9 is GND.

Serial interface is an option, but that appears to be just the DB-25
connector to connect to pins on the board, with the actual serial I/O
being bit-banged via PD0-PD4 on the MN1271 PIA. But receive is done
with SD1 on the PIA.
