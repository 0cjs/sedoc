Git Commit Message Trailers
===========================

* `Co-authored-by:` [GitHub standard][gh-multiauth] for multiple
  author attribution. If the co-author email address is associated
  with a GitHub account, the commit should appear in that account's
  activity list.

* `Reviewed-by:` My standard for indication of review, and that of
  others as well, notably the [Linux kernel][linux-sub], though it's
  [only on 5-10% of commits][linux-rev] there.

* `Signed-off-by:` See [so-1962094].

### Other sources of trailer conventions

* Git Wiki [CommitMessageConventions][gw-conv]
