TLS (SSL) Information
=====================

Below, SEIS is the [Information Security Stack Exchange][SEIS].

Viewing Certificates
--------------------

To connect to a server and view the certificate chain it returns:

    openssl s_client </dev/null -showcerts \
        -servername www.example.com -connect www.example.com:443

The optional `-servername` argument determines the server name sent
via [SNI] for hosts that return different certs based on that.

Stdout includes both basic cert information and the encoded certs
themselves (in [PEM] format: `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` etc.); stderr
will print information about validation done by the client. Piping
stdout through:

    openssl x509 -noout -text

will return a detailed deconstruction of about the _first_ cert
returned, which is generally (always?) the client's certificate. To
see certs further up the chain (the second and subsequent certs) you
can save stdout to a file and extract the certs by hand.

There are lots of variations on this at [so-7885785].

I should write another program that automates the above stuff. (The
one I previously wrote is lost to the archives of some previous
employer.)


Testing
-------

* [badssl.com] seems the best for client testing.
* [SSL Labs Client Test]
* The [Symantic View Browser Warnings][sy-bw] page offers links
  to sites that should trigger various warnings in the client.
  Unfortunately not usable with Chrome >=66 because most certs
  are old enough to trigger `ERR_CERT_SYMANTEC_LEGACY`.
* [Digicert][digicert-check] offers a service that checks certs
  from servers.
* [Geekflare] offers a list of various TLS testing sites.


Certificates
------------

* [Extended Validation Certficates][EV] assert the legal identity
  of a certificate owner.
* [HTTP Strict Transport Security][HSTS] pins public keys.
  * User-installed root CAs in Chrome are [exempted from certficate
    public key pinning requirements][imperialviolet.org/pinning].

Connectivity
------------

Wikipedia [HTTP Tunnel] page discusses `CONNECT` used for TLS
tunneled through proxies and alternate tunnel methods. [Proxytunnel]
uses connect for tunnelling arbitrary apps via both TCP and TLS
(via OpenSSL) tunnelling through `CONNECT`.


TLS Interception / SSL Inspection
---------------------------------

[Corporate MITM][] (to use the less polite term) is a common thing.
See [se-33976], [se-87415], etc. Also national: [se-172024]. And
problematic, in part because most products that do this are broken.

* [durumeric2017] "The Security Impact of HTTPS Interception."
  First comprehensive study. Summary/analysis at [HTTPS Interception
  Harming Security][sslstore-harming]. Also [nemertes].
* [CERT TA17-075A] Technical Alert "HTTPS Interception Weakens TLS
  Security." Covers only TLS vulnerabilities introduced by the
  inspection itself, and not any other environmentally introduced
  vulnerabilities (e.g., logging).
* [CERT2015] "The Risks of SSL Inspection."

  Broken products. Lots of references.

Detecting and migigating MITM attacks:

* SEIS [Mitigation against MITM at Starbucks][se-84323]
* SEIS [How to know if your company does TLS intercept][se-129719]
* SEIS [How can end-users detect malicious attempts at SSL spoofing
  when the network already has an authorized SSL proxy?][se-16293]

[BCP 188] is a starting point for researching pervasive monitoring
mitigation.
