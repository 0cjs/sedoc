Why SMS is Bad for Two-step (2FA, MFA) Authentication 
-----------------------------------------------------

In 2016-06 NIST published a [public preview draft][800-63Bgit] of
[NIST Special Publication 800-63B][800-63B], "Digital Identity
Guidelines Authentication and Lifecycle Management." In that edition,
ยง5.1.3.2 Out-of-Band Verifiers stated:

> Due to the risk that SMS messages or voice calls may be intercepted
> or redirected, implementers of new systems should carefully consider
> alternative authenticators....
> Out-of-band authentication using [SMS or voice] is deprecated, and
> is being considered for removal in future editions of this guideline.

Since then the [800-63B] has been released and now includes in an
update dated 2017-06-05 ([beb5df7]) ยง5.1.3.3 Authentication using the
Public Switched Telephone Network:

> Use of the PSTN for out-of-band verification is RESTRICTED as
> described in this section and in Section 5.2.10. If out-of-band
> verification is to be made using the PSTN, the verifier SHALL verify
> that the pre-registered telephone number being used is associated
> with a specific physical device. Changing the pre-registered
> telephone number is considered to be the binding of a new
> authenticator and SHALL only occur as described in Section 6.1.2.

> Verifiers SHOULD consider risk indicators such as device swap, SIM
> change, number porting, or other abnormal behavior before using the
> PSTN to deliver an out-of-band authentication secret.
