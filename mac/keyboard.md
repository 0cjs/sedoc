Japanese Input
--------------

On US or other keyboards without カな and 英数 keys you need to configure
the Input Sources shortcut under the Shortcuts tab in Keyboard settings.

"Select the previous input source" and "Select next source in input
menu" are configured to `^Space` and `^⌥Space` which will conflict
with Spotlight and Finder search. I normally remap Spotlight to
`⌘Space` and Finder search to `⌥⌘Space`.
