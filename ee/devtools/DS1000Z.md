Rigol DS1000Z Series (1054Z) Oscilloscope Notes
===============================================

XXX How to clear previous settings when starting new analysis?

UI Hints
--------

- To use vertical scale controls for the Math channel, you need to press
  `MATH` _twice_, to be not in the top level math menu but the "Math" menu
  below that..

Printing
--------

The print button will create a `DS1Z_QuickPrint#.png` file where `#` is the
lowest number starting from `1` that is not already on the USB disk. The
file will always dated 2014-11-01 21:00:00.

Triggering
----------

Triggering and trigger status display (at upper left):
- _Single_ waits for trigger condition, triggers once, and stops. (`STOP`)
- _Normal_ retriggers every time it sees the trigger condition, stopping
  when it doesn't see it. (`WAIT` and `T'D`)
- _Auto_ forces a trigger if it doesn't see a trigger condition. (`AUTO`
  and `T'D`) XXX How long does it scan before forcing?
- _Force_ button forces a single capture (except when stopped) continuing
  in that mode after.

Trigger coupling (Menu/Setting/Coupling), valid only with edge triggers,
can be set to DC/AC/LFR/HFR independently of the input coupling:
- `DC`
- `AC`: blocks all DC components, attenuates signals < 75 Hz.
- `LFR` (LF reject): blocks DC components, rejects LF < 75 kHz.
- `HFR` (HF reject): rejects high frequency components > 75 kHz.
