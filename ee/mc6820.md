Motorola MC6820/6821 Peripheral Interface Adapter (PIA)
=======================================================

The [MC6820], MC6821 and MOS MCS6520 are identical in operation but
with slightly different electrical characteristics. Similar chips with
more functionality include the 6532 RIOT, 6530 RRIOT, MOS 6522 VIA,
and MOS 6526 CIA. Material here is taken from the 1985 [MC6821 data
sheet][data] unless otherwise noted.

The ports have different electrical characteristics:
- Port A has internal pullups to allow it to drive CMOS inputs (min
  3.5 V for high, rather than TTL 2.7 V). These are always connected
  so the port will sink more chip current even when used as an input.
- Port B uses standard totem-pole outputs and will float (tri-state)
  any pins set to input mode.
- Port A reads in output mode will read the current state of the pin,
  which may not be the written state if an external device is pulling
  the line low.
- Port B reads in output mode will read a latch with the last-written
  output, not the current level of the pins themselves.

Reset sets all registers to 0.

Registers addressed by `RS1`, `RS0`:

      0     Port A direction/data (DDR, DR)
      1     Port A control register (CR)
      2     Port B direction/data (DDR, DR)
      3     Port B control register (CR)

The direction register is enabled when bit 2 of the CR is 0. Write `0`
for input, `1` for output. CR bit 2 = 1 enables data register.
- Port A input pins have a 1.5 TTL load internal pullup. Reads of
  output pins reads the voltage on the pin: >2.0V → 1, <0.8V → 0. This
  will not match the output data bit if the line is loaded.
- Port B input pins are high-impedence (tri-state). Outputs read the
  value written to the data register. (Confirm!)

Control registers (x = A or B indicating port):

      Bit
       7    IRQ1x flag; set on data avail. (even if b0=0)
       6    IRQ2 flag
       5    CA2 direction: 0=input, 1=output
       4    depends on bit 5
       3    depends on bit 5
       2    0=DDR enabled; 1=data register enabled
       1    IRQ1x set on CA transition direction: 0=high→low; 1=low→high
       0    /IRQx pin follows IRQ1x flag; 0=disable; 1=enable
