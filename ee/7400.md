Caps between power and ground?

Levels and Families
-------------------

### Levels

These vary with individual parts; always verify with data sheet.
CMOS may generally be run up to 15 V with approx.
0.3\*Vcc = LOW max and min HIGH = 0.7\*Vcc.

|    OUTPUT | min low | LOW max | min HIGH | high max |
|----------:|--------:|:--------|---------:|:---------|
|   5V CMOS |     0.0 | 0.05    |     4.95 | 5.0      |
| ATMega328 |     0.0 | 0.9     |     4.2  | 5.0      |
|   5V  TTL |     0.0 | 0.5     |     2.7  | 5.0      |
| 3.3V CMOS |     0.0 | 0.5     |     2.4  | 3.3      |

|     INPUT | min low | LOW max | min HIGH | high max |
|----------:|--------:|:--------|---------:|:---------|
|   5V CMOS |     0.0 | 1.5     |     3.5  | 5.0      |
| ATMega328 |     0.0 | 1.5     |     3.0  | 5.0      |
|   5V  TTL |     0.0 | 0.8     |     2.0  | 5.0      |
| 3.3V CMOS |     0.0 | 0.8     |     2.0  | 3.3      |

For interfacing, `74x245` octal bus transceivers with 3-state outputs:
* `74HC245`: CMOS → CMOS
* `74VC245`: 3.3V CMOS → 5V TTL
* `74HCT245`: 5V TTL → 5V CMOS

#### Sources

* 3.3V CMOS levels from `74LVT04` Hex Inverter.
* "Interfacing Considerations" on the [Wikipedia TTL page][wp-ttl] has
  a brief discussion of levels and current.
* Sparkfun's [Logic Levels][spark-levels] is a basic discussion. Its
  many references are mostly in this list.
* Interfacebus.com's [Logic Threshold Voltage Levels][ib-levels] has a
  bar graph representation of interface voltage levels for various
  families. ([Digital Logic Information][ib-digital] links to a
  low-level logic voltage chart and other information.)
* JeeLabs post [Voltage: 3.3 vs 5][jee-33vs5] discusses running an
  Arduino at 3.3V (apparently ok even at 16 MHz), mixing 3.3V and 5V
  devices, and using a 1K Ohm resistor to limit current to allow
  (slow) 5V inputs on 3.3V digital pins via limiting by the ESD
  diodes.
* Radical Brad's [VIC-20 JetPack][rbv20] gives levels and the chips he
  uses for interfacing.
* All About Circuits' [Logic Signal Voltage Levels][aac-lsvl] is a
  detailed tutorial also discussing Schmitt triggers, pullup resistors,
  open collector interfacing, etc.
* Microchip's [3V Tips 'n Tricks] is a catalog of techniques for
  interfacing between 3.3V and 5V parts including power, digital and
  analog interfaces. Some calculations required.
* TI Application Report [Migration From 3.3 V to 2.5 V Power Supplies
  for Logic Devices][scea005] has a nice voltage level diagram  for 5V
  CMOS/TTL, 3.3V and 2.5V on page 2 (PDF page 14), some logic family
  information (including AHC and LVCH), notes on tolerance of
  higher-level families, and some fairly technical information on
  capacitive load and propagation delays.

### Families

- "Sub-types" on the [Wikipedia TTL page][wp-ttl] has some families.
- Interfacebus.com's [Digital Logic Information][ib-digital] page has
  lots of information on glue logic families and how to choose them.
- LS loads signal lines a lot more than HC; outputs can't pull high
  enough into some CMOS loads for them to consistently recognize HIGH
- HC is fast enough for 4 MHz; AC required for faster.

#### Special

* __610__, __611__, __612__, __613__: Memory mappers. [TI SN74LS610].
  Takes top 4 bits of address bus and remaps to 12 bits via 16 mapping
  registers. Appears pretty slow.


General Usage Notes
-------------------

[Open collector]/open drain outputs are low-Z to ground (pull down) on 0,
hi-Z (unconnected) on 1.
- Multiple outputs can be connected to one line (wired AND).
- Use pull-up restor (5K6?) to Vcc to bring hi-Z → high signal.
- Usu. collector voltage rating is higher than chip Vcc so can be used to
  interface 5V to 12V, TTL to CMOS, etc.

Multiple enable pins like G1, G̅2̅A̅, G̅2̅B̅ (G for "gate"?) are designed to
allow using three chips together without external inverters, or four with
one external inverter. Inputs to G1, G̅2̅A̅, G̅2̅B̅
- 0: Vcc, A0, A1
- 1:  A0, A1, A1
- 2:  A1, A0, A0
- 3: Vcc,  L,  L where L = A0 NAND A1 or NOT A1
