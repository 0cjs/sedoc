Ordering Parts
==============

For small orders, [Marutsu] is reasonably cheap and resells all Digi-Key stock.
- In-store pickup: no charge (cash payment available).
- < ¥3,500: shipping ¥385-550 (XXX check this)
- ≥¥3,500: free shipping

[Digi-key] always ships from the U.S., charging $16.50 or ¥2,000 for 4-day
shipping with UPS Worldwide Saver or FedEx International Priority. The same
account is used on all sites, but if you order through the U.S. site
instead of the [Japanese site][digi-key-jp] you will save about 7% on both
parts cost and shipping.
