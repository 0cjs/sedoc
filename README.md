sedoc - Systems Engineering Notes
=================================

These are personal notes I find handy when I'm doing programming,
systems administration, network engineering, and the like.

Design and Purpose of this Documentation
----------------------------------------

In [Thinking about Thinking][progstone], Alan G. Carter proposed that
software and systems developers divide into two categories:
- _packers_ who tend to be good at memorization and remember details
  of what they need to know, regardless of interrelationships or
  inconsistencies between them, and
- _[mappers]_, who tend to remember and use information by creating
  and updating a logical model from which individual details can be
  derived.

I have a poor memory for all but the most important details, and
possibly that forced me to become a mapper if I wasn't already one by
nature. When learning about something, writing a document about it (or
updating my existing documentation) serves two purposes:

1. It helps or even forces me to develop or update a model of how the
   thing works, or at the very least leave markers for areas where I
   don't at the moment have time to properly understand something.
2. It leaves me with a reference that can later assist me to restore
   that model if I've forgotten it or any of its details.

This is a repository of that documentation. It may or may not be
useful to others (the links my sources are the most likely to be
useful); you may be better off creating your own repository like this.

I can say that over the last several years of writing and maintaining
this repository the initial investment in writing down the information
has paid off handsomely. It's most noticable when I need to do again
something I've done in the past and know I understood well then,
realize I've forgotten what I need to know now, and then discover I
didn't make notes on it. It's then wish I'd taken the extra time to
make notes in the first first place, to avoid wasting time relearning
the topic later.
