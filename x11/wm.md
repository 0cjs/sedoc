X11 Windows Management and Managers
===================================

Window managers divide into three basic categories:
- [Stacking]: e.g. fvwm, dwm.
- [Compositing]: e.g., Xfce, Compiz.
  - Standalone compositors include [compton], xcompmgr.
- [Tiling]: e.g., emacs, tmux, awesome, dwm, i3, xmonad, Compiz


### FVWM Notes

- [Fvwm-Nightshade] is a user-friendly configuration system with
  dialogue boxes and whatnot. It's written in Python 2.7.
