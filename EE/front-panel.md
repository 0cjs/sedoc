Computer Front Panel Notes
==========================

Example in [Homebrow 6809 Computer: First Test][yt sarnoff] video. Display
is BA and BS LED, hex address and data. When processor halted, uses a Bus
Acquire switch to activate panel switches and display. One set of 16
switches; pushbuttons for Addr Load, Data Load, Next Addr, Prev Addr.
Setting the address with any of the three buttons reads that memory
location and displays it. (Writes reset vector to set start point.)
