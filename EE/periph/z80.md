Z80 Peripherals
===============

This is the standard set of peripherals that Zilog introduced along with
their Z80 processor. Many of them differ from the Intel peripheral chips
that perform similar functions.

[Z80 Family CPU Peripherals][z80periph] documents the CTC, DMA, SIO and PIO
chips, and [z80.info] includes many manuals, datasheets and programming
tutorials related to these devices.


CTC
---

Devices include the Z8430, Z84C30, Z84C300s, etc. (_s_ indicates a clock
speed.)

Global I/O includes:
- `CLK`: system clock input
- `I̅N̅T̅`, `I̅O̅R̅Q̅`, `IEI`, `IEO`: Z80 mode 2 interrupt control and daisy-chaining.
- `A₁`/`A₀` or `CS₁`/`CS₀` for address selection
- Data bus and other signals for handling reads/writes.

The CTC has four channels, 0 through 3, each which has:
- A `CLK/TRGₙ` input pin. Pulses are asynchronous, but must have a width of
  at least twice the `CLK` period and lead a `CLK` rising edge by at least
  1/2 clock cycle. Pulses take effect on the 2nd rising edge after
  `CLK/TRG` is asserted.
- A `ZC/TOₙ` zero-count/timeout output pin (excepting channel 3).
- Internal registers for the control word, an 8-bit time constant (1-256),
  an 8-bit down-counter and a prescaler dividing by 16 or 256.

At power up the CTC state is unstable and a `R̅E̅S̅E̅T̅` signal must be
provided. This stops all down-counters, disables all interrupts, and all
`ZC/TO` and interrupt outputs go inactive. All channels must be completely
reprogrammed after this. (Any individual channel can also be reset through
software; see below.)

Each channel has an associated address selected with `A₁`/`A₀`. Reads from
the address read the down-counter contents. Writes to the address write a
control word and, depending on the control word, an optional value in a
second write.

A channel is configured two one of two modes:
0. __Timer mode.__ The timing source is the system clock divided by the
   prescaler (÷16 or ÷256) which decrements the down-counter for every
   clock cycle. The down-counter start method is selected via bit 3 TIMER
   TRIGGER of the control word to be immediate when the time constant is
   loaded or when a high pulse is received on the channel's `CLK/TRG`
   input (see above for timing).
1. __Counter mode:__ The timing source is pulses on the `CLK/TRG` input
   associated with that channel (see above for timing); each pulse
   decrements the down-counter.

In either case, when the down counter reaches zero a positive-going pulse
(about one clock cycle long) is generated on the channel's `ZC/TO` output
and, if configured, an interrupt is generated..

### Channel Programming

Bit 0 of a write indicates whether an interrupt vector word or control
word is being written.

Interrupt vectors are given as the base address of an array of four words
for channels 0, 1, 2 and 3 respectively.

    Bits  Setting
    ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    b7-3  5 MSbits of interrupt vector base (8-byte aligned)
    b2-1  ignored (internally, channel identifier 0-3)
     b0   =1 for Interrupt Vector Word

The control word is a byte with the following format:

    Bit  Setting              0 ── Value ── 1
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     b7  Interrupt         disabled      enabled
     b6  Mode              timer         counter
     b5  Prescaler Value   ÷16           ÷256
     b4  CLK/TRG Edge      falling       rising
     b3  Timer Trigger     autostart     CLK/TRG pulse
     b2  Time Constant     not provided  time constant follows
     b1  Reset             continue      software reset
     b0  Word Type         chan.control  -

If `b2=1` above, the next write must be an 8-bit time constant to load into
the time constant register for that channel. (0 = time constant 256.)

### Interrupts

Any channel can generate an interrupt on timeout; for channel 3 this is the
only output option. Interrupts must be used in Z80 mode 2. When a channel
is configured to interrupt, `I̅N̅T̅` is lowered at the zero count, the Z80
acks with `M̅1̅` and `I̅O̅R̅Q̅`, and the CTC places the configured interrupt
vector on the bus. The CTC then waits to see an `rti` instruction and
presents any further waiting interrupts. The channels are prioritised in
the standard Z80 fashion with channel 0 at highest and channel 3 at lowest
priority.
