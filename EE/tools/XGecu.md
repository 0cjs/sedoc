Wine Setup
----------

The native Windows software, XGPro, works under Wine on Linux.
- It's 32-bit, so ensure you have 32- as well as 64-bit Wine installed.
  Remember to remove `~/.wine` after installing the 32-bit Wine.
- Extract the rar (Debian `unrar` package) to get a single setup program;
  run it under Wine. (32-bit, so install to `C:\Program Files (x86)\`.)
- "USB driver for Windows (DPInst.exe) does not execute on your current
  Operating System" is expected and can be ignored.
- Fetch [setupapi.dll][] (from radiomanV/TL866) and copy it to the
  installation folder.
- Create `/etc/udev/rules.d/50-xgpro.rules` with `SUBSYSTEM=="usb",
  ATTR{idVendor}=="a466", ATTR{idProduct}=="0a53", GROUP="plugdev",
  MODE="0660"`. (Ensure you're in plugdev group, or use mode 0666, or
  whatever.
- Reload with `udevadm trigger`. (Not required to replug programmer.) Can
  check w/`lsusb` to find bus and device, and `ls -l /dev/bus/usb/â€¦`.

#### Errors

Unfortunately, without setupapi.dll in that dir, XGecu can't connect to
the programmer. With it, I get:

    0024:err:module:import_dll Loading library SETUPAPI.dll (which is needed by L"C:\\Program Files\\XGPro\\Xgpro.exe") failed (error c000012f).
    0024:err:module:LdrInitializeThunk Importing dlls for L"C:\\Program Files\\XGPro\\Xgpro.exe" failed, status c0000135
