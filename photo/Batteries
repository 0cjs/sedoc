To replace the Mercury PX625 battery used in older cameras, options are,
best to worst:

    1. Get the camera modified by a repairman.

    2. Use a battery adapter. Expensive (3000 yen or so) and apparently
    sometimes they're a bit too big and the battery compartment won't
    close fully.

    3. Use a silver-oxide 625 replacement. This has a higher voltage,
    so the exposure will be off by 1-4 stops. (But which direction?) It
    does have constant output, so the exposure will be off by the same
    amount at all times if the meter uses the battery's voltage as a
    reference voltage.

    4. Use an alkaline LR43 or whatever battery. Some cameras will
    do ok; others try to use the output voltage of the battery as a
    reference voltage and will change the light meter reading as the
    alkaline battery's voltage declines over its discharge life.

Lots of info on this:
