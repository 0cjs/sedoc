I hadn't considered making my own - thanks for the idea! A quick search
did in fact turn up a recipe. I don't know how readily available the
required chemicals are, but it doesn't sound like an overly complicated
process. Guess what I'm doing Wednesday?!?

Here's the recipe, as found here:

Boiled Water @125 degrees 750ml
Sod. Sulfite 35.0 grams
Hydroquinone 6.0 grams
Phenidone 0.2 grams
Sod. Bisulfite 6.0 grams
Boiled Water to make 1.0 liter


"B" Bath

Boiled Water @125 degrees 750ml
Sod. Sulfite 65.0 grams
Sodium Metaborate 20.0 grams
Boiled Water to make 1.0 liter
