Color films consist of three layered B/W emulsions, along with dyes
to control which colours each layer responds to. The top is blue, the
middle is green, and the bottom is red. The development works with the
dye couplers to produce subtractive complements of red green and blue:
cyan magenta and yellow. Bleach re-oxidises the silver halides back to
silver, since we're no longer interested in the b/w negative that was
simultaniously produced. The fixer later removes all of that silver
(both the undeveloped and the developed-but-reverted-by-the-bleach) and
we're left with the colour dyes. Colour film also has an orange mask to
control contrast and correct for colour deficiencies.

This is a summary of the C41 process in a sink-line processor.
There is also a C-41B process that shortens the fixing time and
eliminates the washes.

All times incude a ten second drain time at the end of each step.
Developer time is exact; the rest are minimums (but don't go to an hour
or something dumb like that). Temperature is 24 to 41 degC for all
stages after development.

Manual agitation, for all steps except final wash and stabilization:

    1. Immerse rack into developer, tap on bottom to dislodge air
    bubbles. Raise rack out of developer, then reimmerse. Takes 4-5
    seconds.

    2. Let sit for 10 seconds. Lift straight out and reimmerse without
    draining. Takes 2-3 seconds. Repeat every 10 seconds.

    3. Ten seconds before end of development, raise out of developer,
    tilt and allow to drain for remaining time.

    If contrast is too low, agitate more frequently. If too high,
    agitate less frequently.

Steps:

    Development: 3:15, 37.8 degC +/- 0.15 degC

        This temperature is the recommended temperature during
        development, not the recommended starting temperature for
        the developer. The developer starting temperature should be
        calibrated by finding the temperature drop 60 seconds after film
        is inserted and agitated normally.

        Agitate for the first 15 seconds, and then every 30 seconds.
        z131 section 3 describes a combined manual/nitrogen burst system
        that's somewhat complex.

        Portra 400UC and 800 can be pushed; add 30 seconds for N+1, and
        60 seconds for n+2. Or, according to Jobo (for any film), add
        15% for each stop of push, though this may lose color balance.
        Don't pull, instead develop less in printing.


        Temperature loss can be compensated for by increasing
        development time to somewhere between 3:15 and 3:45.

    Bleach: 6:30

        "Hobby" systems combine this with the fix stage as a
	"bleach/fix" stage.

        Bleach must be aerated by vigourous stirring. You can also do
        this by putting the solution into a container twice the size and
        shaking vigorously for 30s. Do this at least once a week.

	After this step you can turn on the lights.

    Wash: 3:15

	Running water, use initial agitation only.
	Or change water every 30s.

    Fix: 6:30

	Kodak FLEXICOLOR Fixer and Replenisher

    Final Wash: 3:15

	Running water, use initial agitation only.
	Or change water every 30s.

	Jobo recommends 5:00 for this step.

    Stabilize: 1:30

	Agitation: continuous manual agitation for first 15
	seconds only.

	Jobo recommends, for this step only, doing it off the
	processor at room temperature.

        Stabilizers are used to fix or tan the organic dyes in the
        film. Some modern films don't need this, and you can use just a
        wetting agent instead. Many stabilizers (though not any Tetenal
        ones) contain formaldehyde, a carcinogen. For these, good
        ventilation is essential.

Jobo's hand-development process is:

    1. The working solutions must be brought to the process temperature
    chosen.

    2. The developing tank containing the film should be brought to the
    selected process temperature. Preheat the outside of the tank (in a
    water bath) for 5 minutes.

    3. In order to keep the developer temperature constant during the
    process, the tank should be placed in a water bath with as much
    heated water as possible.

    4. The temperature of the water bath is maintained by adding hot
    water, if no electric heater is available.

    5. The tank with the films inside is tapped against a table-top
    after the solutions have been poured in, to remove bubbles adhering
    to the film.

    6. Then the tank is agitated continuously for 30 seconds inverting
    the tank one cycle each second.

    7. The next 15 seconds the tank will remain in the water bath.

    8. During the remaining processing time, the tank is agitated once
    every 15 seconds. Between agitation cycles, the tank should remain
    immersed in the water bath.

    Bleach-fix**		45ºc		4 minutes 30 seconds

Usage/Replenishment:

    Developer capacity (regular or LORR working solution), if not
    replenished, is 3 rolls of 135-36 per litre. Bleach fixer and
    stabilizer is twice that.

    For each metal reel of 135-36:

	FLEXICOLOR Developer replenisher: 66.2
	FLEXICOLOR Developer replenisher LORR: 33.1
	FLEXICOLOR Bleach III, Fixer, Stabilizer III replenisher: 69

    For plastic reels, increase bleach, fixer and stabilizer by 25%.

    This stuff keeps in brimfull bottles for 6 weeks (developer)
    or 8 weeks (the rest of it).
