Notes on Learning
-----------------

Sequence of Play:
- 6. Impulse Procedure
  - Reserve Power:
    - Allocation of charged batteries on on any impulse. Cannot operate
      systems more often than rules allow (e.g., no 2nd phaser fire).
    - Shields reinforced after enemies resolve fire, so affects that fire.
    - Unallocated warp power can be used during turn up to number of
      _discharged_ batteries (inc. discharged in energy allocation phase);
      unused charges batteries at end of turn.
