Japanese Input
--------------

The "tabs" described below are in the System Preferences tool,
Keyboard section.

If you don't have a Japanese input source already configured, you can
add it under the Input Sources tab. On US or other keyboards without
カな and 英数 keys the Shortcuts tab will offer an "Input Sources"
section where you can enable "Select the previous input source" and
"Select next source in input menu."

The default keybindings for the above are menu" are configured to
`^Space` and `^⌥Space`; on a US Mac these don't conflict with with
Spotlight and Finder search, which are `⌘Space` `⌥⌘Space`. On Japanese
Macs, however, I think Spotlight/Finder search are mapped to `^Space`
etc. However, on the same Mac in guest mode `⌘Space` changes input
method, so I'm not sure what's really supposed to be what here.
