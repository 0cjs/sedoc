MS Outlook Tips
===============

Viewing Email Headers
---------------------

Bring the e-mail up in a separate window by double-clicking on the
message in the message list pane (usually between the folder pane and
the preview pane). Click the "File" tab and then the "Properties"
icon. The dialog box that appears will have a small text box with the
Internet headers; click in it, select all and copy with `Ctrl-A
Ctrl-C`, and then paste it into an editor for easy viewing.
