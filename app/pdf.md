Linux PDF Viewers and Tools
===========================

Viewers
-------

- `zathura`: Vi-style user interface. Needs more development, but
  what's there works well.


Editors
-------

- `pdfshuffler`: Simple GUI program to let you add (merge),
  remove and re-arrange pages to create a new PDF document from
  existing ones. Written in Python

Also see [JakeLittle's post][jakelittle] discussing the Linux
toolchain he uses for PDF editing (pdftk, qpdf, pdfbeads, pdftotext,
pdfimages, ImageMagick, ScanTailor).


Web-based
---------

- <https://pdfresizer.com>: Merge, split, resize, convert, crop,
  rotate, optimize, reorder, delete pages. For some reason the
  multipage/N-up tool isn't linked from the top page, but is at
  <https://pdfresizer.com/multipage>.
