Pytest Fixtures
===============

Fixtures may also be added by marking the test:
`@pytest.mark.usefixtures("my_fixture")`. This can be is useful on
`unittest` tests and similar.

### Sharing Fixtures

Fixtures in [`conftest.py`](pytest-config.md#conftest.py) will be
automatically discovered and made available for all tests in that directory
and all subdirectories. See [the documentation][fixture-conftest]) for more
information on sharing, such as [scoping](pytest.md#scopes) a shared
fixture to load test data only once.

### Discovery

You can also set [a session-fixture which can look at all collected
tests][collection-fixture].

#### Parametrization

Fixtures can be [parametrized](pytest.md#parametrization). Tests using the
fixture will be called once for each value in the sequence provided as the
[`params` argument][parametrizing-fixtures]; the fixture is responsible for
changing its behaviour appropriately, usually by checking `request.param`.

Multiple parameterized fixtures generate tests using the set product of all
`params` arguments (i.e., all possible combinations).

    @pytest.fixture(params=['a', 'b', 'c'])
    def myfixture(request):
        return request.param

    def test_run_mutiple_times(myfixture):
        assert 'b' == myfixture             # Passes once, fails twice
