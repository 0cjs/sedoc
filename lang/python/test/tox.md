tox: virtualenv-Based Automation of Test Activities
======================================================

[tox] is both a [tool] and a file format for `tox.ini` that is read by
other tools.

The tool is designed to automate the testing of [distuils] packages in
various environments, including with different versions of Python.

`tox-quickstart` will interactively generate a `tox.ini` file. A
[distutils] `setup.py` is required for `tox` to run, however.
