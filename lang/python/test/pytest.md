Python [pytest] Library
=======================

[pytest] ([docs], [wiki]) uses Python's [`assert`] statement
instead of assertion functions and introspection to display values
that fail assertions:

        def test():
            expected = { 1: 'one', 2: 'two', }
            actual   = { 1: 'ichi', 3: 'san', }
    >       assert expected == actual, 'optional message'
    E       AssertionError: optional message
    E       assert {1: 'one', 2: 'two'} == {1: 'ichi', 3: 'san'}
    E         Differing items:
    E         {1: 'one'} != {1: 'ichi'}
    E         Left contains more items:
    E         {2: 'two'}
    E         Right contains more items:
    E         {3: 'san'}
    E         Use -v to get the full diff

    test.py:2: AssertionError

See the [reporting demo][repdemo] for more examples of how failures
are displayed, and [assertions] for details of how to define
`pytest_assertrepr_compare(`_config, op, left, right_`)` to define
custom comparisons and failure displays.

Under the hood, pytest [modifies the AST of test modules][ast-rewrite]
as they are loaded using [PEP 302] import hooks. Can this cause issues
with test frameworks that do their own loading?


Test Discovery
--------------

Pytest from the command line will [discover tests] using paths from
the first of the command line, the [`testpaths`] configuration
variable and the current directory. Files are added directly;
directories (excepting those in [`norecursedirs`]) are recursed to
find `test_*.py` and `*_test.py` files. All are imported by their
[`test package name`] derived from the first parent directory not
containing an `__init__.py` file). (This directory is added to
`sys.path`.) PEP 420 namespace packages without `__init__.py` files
may also work, but this needs to be investigated.

The test functions are those matching `test_*` that are at the
top-level (within the module) or within a `Test*` class that has no
`__init__` method.


Assertions
----------

See [assertions] for the basics, and [builtin] for details on the API
and fixtures. The following is an incomplete summary:

#### [Exceptions]

    import pytest
    def test_exceptions():
        with pytest.raises(ZeroDivisionError):
            1 / 0

        def forever(): forever()

        with pytest.raises(RuntimeError, match=r'max.*exceeded'):
            forever()

        with pytest.raises(RuntimeError) as e:      # e is ExceptionInfo
            forever()
        assert 'maximum recursion' in str(e.value)

Handy `ExceptionInfo` attributes include `type`, `typename`, `value`,
`tb` (raw traceback), `traceback` (Traceback instance),
`match(regexp)` and more.

#### Other Things

* `approx(expected, rel=None, abs=None, nan_ok=False_)` should be
  used to compare floating point numbers:

      {'a': 0.1 + 0.2, 'b': 0.2 + 0.4} == approx({'a': 0.3, 'b': 0.6})

* The `deprecated_call` context manager ensures a block of code
  triggers a `DeprecationWarning` or `PendingDeprecationWarning`.

#### Test Outcomes

Most of the following would normally be done with decorators; see below.

* `fail(msg='', pytrace=True)`: Fail test with _msg_; no stack traceback
  if _pytrace_ is `False`.
* `skip(msg='')`: Skip (the rest of) the current test.
* `importorskip(modname, minversion=None)`: Checks __version__ attribute
  of module and skips if too low or can't load.
* `xfail(reason='')`:
* `exit()`: Exit test process.


Rootdir and Configuration
-------------------------

`pytest -h` will print out the [configuration] determined by the
command line options and config file settings. The rootdir and inifile
are also printed at the start of non-quiet test runs and available in
Python as `config.rootdir` (guaranteed to exist) and `config.inifile`
(may be `None`).

Pytest has a [rootdir][] for each test run used for assigning
_nodeids_ and for storing information between test runs (e.g., the
cache, below). This is set as follows:

1. Use the `--rootdir=path` option if passed on the command line. (Not
   clear if this can be ready from any inifile overriding the
   discovered one below.)
2. Determine common ancestor directory (CAD) of all path args and
   current working directory. (The docs don't make it clear that, even
   with path args, the CWD is still used in this calculation.)
3. The rootdir is the first condition matched below.
   1. `{pytest,tox}.ini`/`setup.cfg` are found CAD-upwards.
   2. `setup.py` is found CAD-upwards.
   3. `{pytest,tox}.ini`/`setup.cfg` are found in any of `args`-upwards.  
      (Does this also check CWD?)
   4. CAD is rootdir.

The files found in steps 1 and 3 above must also meet certain
conditions:
* `pytest.ini` is always used, but but breaks if no `[pytest]` section.
* [`tox.ini`](tox.md) must have a `[pytest]` section.
* `setup.cfg` must have a `[tool:pytest]` section

Pytest has (non-overlapping) command line options and configuration
variables. Command line options can also be set in a config file using
the [`addopts`] config option; config file options can be set on the
command line with `-o option=value` or `--override-ini=option=value`.


Cache
-----

Pytest has a [cache] ([new docs][cache-restruc]) supplied by the
included `cacheprovider` [plugin][plugins] (enabled by default). Data
are stored in `.pytest_cache/` under the [rootdir][] and accessible
via the [`config.cache`] ([API docs][config-cache-API]) object. The
plugin adds the following command line options:

* `--cache-show`: Display cache content (no tests will be run)
* `--cache-clear`: Clear all cache files and values
* `--lf`/`--last-failed`: Re-run only failures
* `--ff`/`--failed-first`: Run failures before remainder of tests
* `-last-failed-no-failures`: Behaviour when last run had no failures
  * `all` (default): Run all tests
  * `none`: Run no tests

The [`cache_dir`] configuration option (â‰¥3.2) moves it elsewhere; it's
an absolute path or relative to `rootdir`.

There is also a [`pytest-cache`] PyPI module which appears to be an
older version of the above `cacheprovider` plugin. (Last release was
2013.)


XXX To-do
