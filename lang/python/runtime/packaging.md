Packaging Python Code
=====================

* Wheel is a newer format than egg.
* Distutils is part of standard library, but functionality is very basic.
* Setuptools recommended over Distutils.

PyInstaller
-----------

[PyInstaller][] (`pip install pyinstaller`; [manual][PyInst-docs]) can
package a script and all its dependencies (including the Python interpreter
binary!) in a single folder or single executable file that can be run on
systems without a Python interpreter installed. However, the build must be
done on the target platform; there are no cross-build facilities.

Notes:
- The app creates a new console window by default; this can be overridden.
- Only .pyc files are included. Options are available for further
  obfuscation, or use cython.
- Arbitrary data can be appended to the end of an ELF or .EXE file; the
  system loader ignores this. PyInstaller appends a CArchive format
  archive; `pyi-archive_viewer` can view the archive.
- See [Run-time Information][pyinst-rti] for use of `__file__`,
  `sys.executable`, `sys.argv[0]`, and notes on finding data files.
- See [Advanced Topics][pyinst-adv] for a description of the the
  application startup process ("bootloader"), the CArchive format,
  executable inspection program `pyi-bindepend`, and using `PYTHONHASHSEED`
  to create bit-for-bit reproducable builds.

`pyinstaller myscript.py` ([manpage][pyinst-man]) will analyze all `import`
statements, but may miss more clever ways of importing code. You can give
additional dependencies (files and import paths) on the command line or
edit the `myscript.spec` created by the first PyInstaller run. (These may
include data files as well.) A "hook" system is also available to specify
"hidden" imports; hooks are included for many popular libraries.

One-file mode changes distribution only; when run it builds a temporary
folder and extracts files to it before running as it would in one-folder
mode. Implications:
- Make sure the bundled app works in one-folder mode before building it in
  one-file mode.
- The temporary folder will be left behind on program crash.
- No-exec `/tmp` will break things; `--runtime-tmpdir` may help with this.
- Do not give admin privs to a one-file app; the extraction has race
  conditions. `seteuid()` may also be problematic.

Programs that use PyInstaller include [docker-compose].


Environment and Dependency Managers
-----------------------------------

* [Pip](./pip.md) w/manual `requirements.txt`: Dependency versions must be
  managed manually. Locks or ranges, not both.
* [pip-tools]
* [Pipenv] Wrapper around `pip` and virtual environments. Uses
  `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` for dependency specs. Recommended for
  applications but not libraries due to strict pinning in
  `Pipfile.lock`.
* [Poetry] has better and more reliable dependency determination than
  Pipenv. Designed for both apps and libraries.
* [Hatch] simplifies/wraps process of creating/managing/testing libs
  and apps (more features than Poetry in this area). No dependency
  graph calculation?

### Pip

`requirements.txt` format:
- `pkgname`
- `pkgname < 6.0`
- `pkgname@git+https://github.com/â€¦/pkgname.git`
