Logic
=====

- _Combinatory_ logic (mathematics): Mathematical combinators. Leads
  to lambda calculus.
- _Combinational_  logic (electronics/digital logic): Output is a pure
  function of boolean operators (as opposed to _sequental_ logic).
  Also _combinatorial_ logic, but that usage is controversial.

Combinatory Logic
-----------------

Created by Moses Schönfinkel to eliminate the need for quantified
variables (∀x, ∃y). Much work added by Haskell Curry et al.
