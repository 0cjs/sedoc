LISP Implementation Notes
=========================

Maclisp, at least as of 1974 (Moon's ref manual), had two addition
functions: `PLUS` took any numbers as arguments and converted all to
flonums if any one was a flonum, otherwise returned fixnum or bignum
depending on size. `+` took fixnums only and did modular addition.
Interestingly, with no args `(+)` returned `0`, the identity element.
Design or just fallout from the implementation?

Maclisp: `(fix x)` and `(float x)` to convert to fixnum/bignum or
flonum. `(minus x)` returns the negative of its argument.

Interlisp ('74 manual §13.1): Large integers and floating point
numbers are 36 bits, and boxed (stored in heap). Small integers have
absolute value less than 1536 and are boxed "by offsetting them by a
constant so that they overlay an area of INTERLISP's address sapce
that does not correspond to any INTERLISP data type. Thus boxing small
numbers does not use any storage, and furthermore, each small number
has a unique representation, so that `eq` may be used to check
equality." (`eqp` or `equal` must be used for large integers and
floating point.)

Interlisp ('74 manual §13.0): "1000 is an integer, 1000. a floating
point number, as are 1E3 and 1.E3. Note that 1000D, 1000F and 1E3D are
perfectly legal literal atoms." The '83 manual is perhaps more clear:
"A litatom is read as any string of non-delimiting characters that
cannot be interpreted as a number." (`%` was used as the escape
character.)
