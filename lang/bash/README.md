Bash Shell
==========

Old Versions
------------

The current version of Bash is 5.x, but MacOS still ships only 3.x due
to licensing changes. (They've changed their default shell to Zsh.) While
you can get Bash 5.x through [Homebrew], it may be more convenient in
some cases simply to write Bash 3.x-compatible code.

To easily build a copy of Bash 3 for testing, use the [shell-compat-utils]
repo.
