[CMake] is a multi-platform build tool that reads a `CMakeLists.txt`
file, reads/generates a build configuration, and generates
platform-native buildsystem files (e.g., for GNU Make, [Ninja] or
MSBuild) and workspaces to build the project. `CMakeLists.txt` is
stored at the root of the source directory, but the build is usually
done in a separate, empty build directory (referred to as `$build/`
below).

CMake reads C, C++ and Fortran files and automatically computes
dependency information for them. However, when using IDE build systems
it offloads this task to the IDE.

Execute CMake with `cd $build && cmake dir`, where _dir_ is a relative
or absolute path to the directory containing `CMakeLists.txt` or the
path to an existing build directory created by CMake. This will
generate the makefiles; you then need to run `cmake --build .` or your
native build tool (e.g., `make`).

There are also GUIs available: `ccmake` for curses and `cmake-gui` for
a graphical interface. These display `CMakeCache.txt` configuration
variables (as set with the `-C`/`-D` option to `cmake`) for you to set
before generating the buildsystem files. (`cmake -i` for interactive
configuration is no longer supported.)

The simplest build description is:

    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.1)     # Optional but recommended
    project(hello)
    add_executable(hello hello.c)

(We use 3.1 instead of 3.0 to default to new variable names instead of
the deprecated old ones, [CMP0053].)

Architecture
------------

For more details, see the following pages from [the documentation][docs]:

- [cmake-buildsystem(7)]: General introduction to the design of CMake.
- [cmake-language(7)]: Files and language description.
- [cmake(1)]: Command line tool.
- [_The Architecture of Open Source Applications_: CMake chapter][aosa]

CMake creates a _buildsystem_ for _directories_ (also called
_projects_), each of which is a set of source code with the build
definition in a `CMakeLists.txt` file in the root directory of the
source. The buildsystem has _targets_ that are output files or "phony"
(always out of date and thus always built).

Variables used to configure the build are generally not stored in or
read from the process environment (though they can be accessed with
`$ENV{name}`) but instead stored to and read from a single
`CMakeCache.txt` file in the (root) build directory. (These are
divided into normal ones always shown by `ccmake`/`cmake-gui` and
_advanced_ ones, marked with [`mark_as_advanced()`], that are not
displayed unless the show advanced option is on.)

The overall process is three steps of configuration and one of generation:
1. Read `CMakeCache.txt` from the build directory (if it exists).
2. Read `CMakeLists.txt` from the source root directory and execute
   its commands to create a configuration/build representation. This
   step may read further `CMakeLists.txt` files via the `include()`
   and `add_subdirectory()` commands.
3. Write the updated `CMakeCache.txt` file.
4. Developer repeats the above steps as many times as necessary to set
   options revealed by changing other options. (`ccmake` and
   `cmake-gui` disable generation until the developer has seen all
   options at least once).
5. Generate the Makefiles or other target build tool files.

Though multiple `CMakeLists.txt` files may be read, all them together
generate a global build configuration with a single set of targets and
other global state such as cache variables. (This may produce name
collisions.) CMake code read with [`include()`] is executed in the
scope of the caller. [`add_subdirectory()`] adds a new build
subdirectory under the top-level build directory and creates a new
directory scope for the processing of the new `CMakeLists.txt`; the
new source directory need not be a subdirectory of the calling source
dir.

Directory scoping appears to be based on the build directory tree;
commands that use directory scoping "apply to directories below the
project directory" in which they're executed, so presumably to
projects below the project directory. However, it's generally
suggested that properties be set using target-scoped commands (where
they will be propagated/exported to dependents) rather than
directory-scoped where possible. E.g., prefer
[`target_include_directories()`] to set the [target-scoped
`INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`][INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES:tgt] property over
[`include_directories()`] to set the [directory-scoped
`INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`][INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES:dir].


XXX properties

When run, CMake uses a configuration (property settings) in
`$build/CMakeCache.txt`, generating it if necessary. Existing
configuration entries will not be changed or removed, but new ones may
be added. Changing a configuration entry may cause additions; re-run
`cmake` until the configuration no longer changes. Entries can be
specified on first run with the `-C`/`-D` options to `cmake` or in the
GUI tools; entries can be edited by editing the file or using a GUI
tool. `cmake -U glob` will remove entries matching _glob_.

Built targets (executables, libraries, etc.) will be placed in
`$build/`. Intermediate files for each target are placed in
`$build/CMakeFiles/$target.dir`.

#### Scripts

CMake can also directly run script files, without configuring and
producing a buildsystem, with `cmake -P scriptname.cmake`. These files
may not use "project commands" that define build targets or actions.
The allowable commands for this mode are listed in [cmake-commands(7)].


Command Line Tool Invocation
----------------------------

#### cmake

Generate the configuration and buildsystem files.

    cmake sourcedir             # From build directory
    cmake builddir              # After cmake has been run once

CMake can also invoke the native build system with `cmake --build buildir
[opts] -- [native-opts]`; _builddir_ must already have been created with
`cmake sourcedir`.

Setting envvar `VERBOSE=1` makes the build output more verbose (at least
when using the Makefile generator).

Other useful options/modes:
* `--system-information`: Discovered system info and variables. Useful
  to see what variables to check for platform, path or other information.
* `-E command`: Command-line tool mode; `-E help` for a list of
  commands. This lets makefiles etc. do things like copy files and
  directories, make symlinks, generate SHA hashes, set/clear Windows
  registery entries, etc. This can also print CMake capabilities and
  start server mode.
* `--help-command-list`, `--help-variable-list`, `--help-command CMD`,
  `--help-variable VAR`: Print help on commands and variables used in
  `CMakeLists.txt`. (But output is raw reStructuredText.)

#### CTest

Running `ctest` in a build directory will run all the tests, as with
the `test` target of `cmake`. Tests are just command line programs
that have their status code and/or output checked.

#### CPack

Packages software. Generates many different package formats, including
TGZ, ZIP, DEB, RPM, NSIS (Null Soft Installer).

#### CDash

Web application for displaying test results and doing CI testing.


Syntax
------

The detailed reference is [cmake-language(7)].

Files are a sequence of _commands_ and comments:
- Commands have the from `command_name(arg ...)` with zero or more
  arguments in the parentheses. They may be broken across multiple
  lines after the opening paren, but there may not be multiple
  commands on a line.
- Line comments start with `#` and go to end of line. `#` immediately
  followed by a _bracket argument_ (see below) allows multiline
  comments.

Commands, which are not expressions, are divided into two types:
- _Scripting commands_ change the state of the command processor, e.g.
  setting variables or changing the behaviour of other commands
-  _Project commands_ create and modify build targets.

Arguments to commands are separated by whitespace or `;`. In unquoted
arguments whitespace and `;()#"\` must be escaped with a backslash.
Arguments may be quoted with double quotes or brackets (see below).
Unquoted nested parens are passed to commands as individual unquoted
arguments.

Escape sequences, variable expansion, quoting:
- `\x`: Escape sequence.
  - _x_ is one of `;trn`: semicolon, tab, CR, NL.
  - _x_ is any other char: Remove semantic meaning and treat
    literally. (E.g., to escape a space in an argument.)
- `${varname}`: Variable ref. Replaced (before a command is called) by
  variable's value, or empty string if not set. Nested refs are
  evaluated from inside out, e.g. the variable name in `varname` can
  be evaluated with: `${${varname}}`, or `suffix` with
  `${mystuff_${suffix}}`.
- `"`...`"`: Quoted arg. Evaluates _escape sequences_ and _variable
  refs_. Lines may be continued with a backslash at end of line.
- `[[`...`]]`: Bracket argument (â‰¥3.0) which expands neither escape
  sequences nor variable references. Zero or more `=` may be used
  between the brackets to allow bracket use in the arg, e.g.,
  `[==[`...`]==]`. Neither escape sequences nor variable references
  are expanded.

Variable names are alphanumeric, `/_.+-` and escape sequences. (`$` is
also permitted but discouraged.)

#### [`if()`]

    if(expr) ... elseif(expr) ... else() ... endif()

In some expressions variables names can be passed as arguments which
are evaluated by the command itself. Thus with `set(var1 OFF)`,
`set(var2 "var1")`: `if(${var2})` â‡’ false but `if(var2)` â‡’ true.

#### [`foreach()`], [`while()`]

Loops. `break()` and `continue()` available.

    foreach(varname arg1 arg2 ...)
    foreach(varname RANGE total)
    foreach(varname RANGE start stop [step])
    foreach(varname IN [LISTS [list1 [...]]]
                       [ITEMS [item1 [...]]])

Records commands up to `endforeach()` and iterates their execution.
Empty `LIST` values are a zero-length item.

    while(expr)     # _expr_ same as if()
    endwhile()

#### [`function()`], [`macro()`]

    function(name param0 param1 ...)
      ...
    endfunction()

    macro(name param0 param1)
    endmacro()

    name(one two)

Define a new commands. Calling with fewer arguments than there are
formal parameters is an error, but extra arguments may be supplied.

Parameters to which the arguments are bound are:
- `ARGV0`, _param0_: First argument.
- `ARGV1`, _param1_: Second argument.
- `ARGV2`, `ARGV3`, ...: Subsequent arguments.
- `ARGC`: Argument count.
- `ARGV`: All arguments as `;`-separated list.

Scoping:
- `function()` creates a new scope at call time; and variables are
  scoped to the function unless `set(... PARENT_SCOPE)` is used.
- `macro()` uses the scope of the caller. This is the only way to get
  "output" as commands are not expressions.


Variables
---------

Variable scoping is dynamic. The search order is:
- Function scope created with `function()`.
- Directory scope created by `CMakeLists.txt` file.
- Cache scope persisted across runs in `$build/CMakeCache.txt`.
- Environment variables are in a separate scope accessed via
  `$ENV{name}` and do not use the search rules above.

Variable names are alphanumeric, `/_.+-` and escape sequences. (`$` is
also permitted but discouraged.)

Variable values are always strings. Unset variables expand to an empty
string. Some commands may parse variables as different types, including:
- Boolean:
  - False: `OFF`, `0`, empty string.
  - True: `ON`, `1`, unrecognised string.
- Lists of elements separated by `;`.

Lists of lists are handled with multiple variable names:

    set(ll a b)
    set(a 1 2 3)
    set(b 4)
    foreach(listname in LISTS ll)
        foreach(value IN LISTS ${listname})
            ...
        endforeach()
    endforeach()

[cmake-variables(7)] lists variables (400+) read/used by CMake, CTest
and CPack.

#### [`set()`], [`unset()`]

Binds a variable name in the current scope or in `PARENT_SCOPE`,
process environment or `CACHE` if specified.

    set(name value ... [PARENT_SCOPE])
    set(ENV{name} value ...)
    set(name value ... CACHE type docstring [FORCE])
    unset(name [CACHE|PARENT_SCOPE])
    unset(ENV{name})

Types for cache values (used by GUI interface) are `BOOL`, `FILEPATH`
(file), `PATH` (directory), `STRING` (values selected from `STRINGS`
property if set) and `INTERNAL`.

Multiple values are stored as a list (a string with elements separated
by `;`). Quoted arguments containing `;` are stored as-is, flattening
lists (`set(name a "b;c")` sets _name_ to `a;b;c`).

#### [`option()`]

    option(varname "help string" [initval])

Provide `ON`/`OFF` option (stored as a cached variable) to developer
Does nothing if _varname_ already set. Provide `-Dvarname=1` or
similar on command line of initial `cmake` run to override default.


Properties
----------

- XXX properties???
- [cmake-properties(7)]
- [`set_property()`]
- Set `INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` with [`include_directories()`], but prefer
  `target_include_directories()`.
- `set_source_file_properties()`


Misc. Scripting Commands
------------------------

- `message()`


Generator Expressions
---------------------

[Generator expressions][cmake-generator-expressions(7)] of the form
`$<...>` can be set in certain properties and given to commands that
populate them, e.g., `INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`, [`include_directories()`],
`target_include_directories()`. These are not evaluated by the command
interpreter, which considers them just strings, but instead by certain
parts of CMake code during build system generation. They allow lookup
of information, conditional evaluation, and generation of output.

Logical expressions evaluate to `0` or `1` and most take `0` or `1` as
input.
- `$<BOOL:...>`: Evaluate `...` to `0` or `1`.
- `$<NOT:?>`: `0`â†’`1`, `1`â†’`0`.
- `$<IF:?,...,...>`.
- `$<STREQUAL:a,b>`, `$<EQUAL:a,b>`: String and numeric comparison.
- `$<IN_LIST:x,xs>`.
- `$<TARGET_EXISTS:target>`.
- etc.

Informational expressions expand to a value:
- `$<CONFIG>`: Configuration name.
- `$<TARGET_FILE_NAME:target>`, `$<TARGET_FILE_DIR:target>`.
- `$<TARGET_PROPERTY:targetname,propname>`: Value of property on given target.
- `$<TARGET_PROPERTY:propname>`: Value of property on target for which
  generator expression is being evaluated.
- etc.

Output expressions generate a string. E.g., for a list of include dirs
preceeded by `-I`, if `INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` is not empty:

    set(idirs "$<TARGET_PROPERTY:INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES>")
    $<$<BOOL:${prop}>:-I$<JOIN:${prop}, -I>>


Build Configuration Declarations
--------------------------------

Commands are divided into "script commands" that may be used with or
without a build configuration (the latter e.g., in `cmake -P
filename.cmake`) and "project commands" that are used only when
defining build configurations in `CMakeLists.txt` and files it
loads/includes.

See [CMake Build Configuration](cmake-config.md) for commands (of both
types) related to configuring builds.
