  > We’ve spoken publicly about Google’s internal code base, and our
  > efforts to keep that code maintainable as it grows. With over 250M
  > lines of C++ code and nearly every project building from head, we’ve
  > demonstrated a different approach to software engineering: one
  > largely free of version mismatch issues and one where even the most
  > common libraries can be refactored regularly, and safely....

  > We believe that the current paradigm for software is inherently
  > unsustainable: dependency management is brutally complex. Unsolvable
  > “diamond dependency” issues are common — the only ways to avoid
  > these are to never change, or to ensure that there aren’t multiple
  > versions. We prefer the latter, so we will do what we can to get you
  > to live at head along with us — if everything is built from source
  > at head, there can be no more diamond dependencies, branch
  > conflicts, and complicated discussions about merge policy. All of
  > that time spent could be spent on more useful things, like actually
  > writing code and solving problems for users. Join with Abseil, and
  > stop paying the content-management tax!
