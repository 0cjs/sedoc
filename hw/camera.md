Camera and Photography Notes
============================

Google Photos
-------------

Three storage options ([settings][gpset]). (There seems [no way to tell][gp
8486259] which option is being used for an item, though you can get an
[overview of all storage use][gpstor].)
- "Original." Uses account storage. Photos/videos not modified.
- "High quality." Unlimited free storage. JPEG-only? Photos ≤ 16 MP and
  videos ≤ 1080p  not modified; larger sizes will be resized down.
  (Captions and other info may be lost.)
- "Express Backup." Like HQ, but 3MP/480p, for faster backup over wireless.

The [settings][gpset] menu also offers a "Recover Storage" button if you
have photos stored as "Original"; this will convert them to "High quality."
(It doesn't tell you what it will convert, or if any of the photos need
conversion at all, though it does tell you how much storage you will save.)

### Shooting and Touch Screen

- `INFO` scrolls through screen/EVF display modes: exposure histogram/
  tilt bars/side icons only/clean display. Hold for clean HDMI output.
- `OK` brings up Super Control Panel (SCP).
- Touch mode on left side scrolls through Off/Focus/Shutter.

Shutter modes: select from SCP; there is no button mapping. Single, ♢Anti-shock
(electronic front curtain), ♡Silent (both curtains electronic), Sequential (low
and high speed), Self Timer (cancel w/`↓`), High-res. Time lapse in `»Shooting1
» (item 7) » Time Lapse`. Anti-shock/silent delays set in `»Shooting2 » (item
5)` (off=don't display item in shutter mode list).

### Menus and Modes

Major menu sections (icons at left) are:
`»Shooting1`, `»Shooting2`, `»Playback`, `»Custom`, `»Setup`.

The standard modes on the mode dial (top, left) are __P A S M movie ▊▚ SCN
ART iAUTO.__ (▊▚=combine several images; SCN=scene). Any mode can be
replaced with Myset1 - Myset4.

The __Multi Function__ button does the currently selected function with a short
press; holding it down and turning either knob will let you scroll through the
functions that can be selected. These are set from `»Custom » D-Disp/🔊/PC »
Multi Function Settings`: Color Creator, ISO/WB dials, WB/ISO dials, Magnify,
Image Aspect ratio and S-OVF.

### Saved Settings and Customisation

- __Reset:__ »Shooting1 » Reset/Myset » Reset menu (p.86,84). Execute with `→ »
  Basic/Full » ← » OK`.
- __Myset:__ `»Shooting1 » Reset/Myset » Myset1` (through Myset4).
  - Restore saved settings with `OK » Yes/No`.
  - Save/clear settings with `→ » » Save/Reset » OK`.
  - Mode not in saved settings; settings can be restored in __P A S M__ modes.
  - Myset# can be assigned to any mode dial position or assignable button.

### Focus

__Manual Focus__ position lost on sleep or power off.

__Magnify__ mode (screeen dim disabled during):
- 1st press brings up location box (uses recent AF position). Or touch screen
  to bring up that position. Move location with touch/`←↓↑→`. `INFO » Dial`
  changes mag size.
- 2nd press magnifies; dials zoom 3×-14×, touch/←↓↑→ moves.
- 3rd press loops to location box; exit by holding button in
- Long press at any time exits, or use screen icon in 1st mode.

__Autofocus:__
- Arrow pad keys or touching screen will chose AF target.
- During target selection press `»INFO » ↓↑` to rotate between:
  - All Targets: camera selects automatically from all.
  - Single Target: camera uses selected target.
  - Small Target: "The AF target can be reduced in size."
  - Group Target: camera selects automatically from all targets in group.
  - Movies and Four-Thirds lenses always use single-target mode.
- `»INFO » ←→` rotates between off/face/face-eye/face-r.eye/face-l.eye prio. (A
  white border indicates a detected face; this also shows in MF.)
- AF Modes:
  - __S-AF__ half-press focuses once and locks (beep)
  - __C-AF__ half-press continutes to refocus after first lock (beep)
  - __MF__ manual focus: lens ring only
  - __S-AF+MF__ Half-press causes AF and lock; manual focus can change this
    afterward while half-pressed. Manual focus before half-press lock will
    cause AF to lock on something nearest that focus.
  - __C-AF+TR__ half-press focuses then tracks target

### Other Notes

__EVF eye sensor__ triggers when screen folded in (facing out or in) and
anything (e.g., finger) is near eyepiece. Hold `|○|` to enable/disable sensor.
- Enabled: EVF on only when sensor is triggered. Tap `|○|` to switch between
  monitor Live View and SCP when EVF sensor not triggered.
- Disabled: EVF always on when screen folded in facing in, otherwise tap `|○|`
  to switch between screen and EVF. (`OK` gives SCP overlaying live-view
  image.)

__S-OVF__ is an "optical" viewfinder mode (icon appears at top) that removes
white balance, exposure compenstation, etc. adjustments from the viewfinder,
allegedly making shadows etc. easier to see.

__Power saving:__
- `»Custom » D-Disp/Sound/PC` has `Backlit LCD` (dim after 8s/30s/60s/-; does
  not dim when in menu or using EVF) and `Sleep` (off/1m/3m/5m). Waking with
  shutter half-press is instant when screen dim, 2-3s from sleep mode (slightly
  faster than power up time).
- `»Custom » K-Utility » Quick Sleep` sets a faster LCD off (blank after
  3s/5s/8s) and sleep (3-60s) that occurs _only_ if 1) eye sensor enabled,
  2) not using EVF, 3) live view off. Otherwise uses non-quick settings above.

__Setup Menu:__ Let you set date/time, menu language, screen colour balance and
brightness, etc. __Rec View__ is how long one post-views an image just taken:
`Auto[▶]` goes into play mode, otherwise `Off/0.3s/0.5s/1-20s` (shutter
half-press exits early).

  - Settings changed in C1/C2 still must be registered to stick.
- Q.Menu button brings up a more limited set of menus over viewfinder
  display; varies based on mode. Arrows or dial selects; close
  w/Q.Menu or Half-SB.

General Photography Controls:

Image management:
- Setup»Auto-Review: after taking pic, show:
  - normal for 0-5s followed by zoom for 0-5s, any control aborts.
  - "hold" goes into playback mode.
  - In autoreview, oversaturated areas blink.
- In playback mode dial zooms, menu unzooms then goes to menus.
- Pics can be marked with Playback»Favorite menu; marking a few allows
  »»Delete All to delete all not marked.

Remote shutter:
- [Schematic and details][dmc-rem-sch 1], [alternate][dmc-rem-sch 2].
  2.5mm TRSM connector; camera supplies 3.1 V on M, expects resistors:
  `M=3.1V ── 36k ── 2k9 ── 2k2 ── S`. Short 36K out of circuit for
  focus pushbutton, additionally short 3K out for shutter button.
  Close values, e.g. 3k3 for 2k9, also work.
