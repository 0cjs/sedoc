Aftershokz OpenMove
-------------------

Bone conduction Bluetooth headphones.

Bug notes:
- Echo to remote end via mic feedback may be fixed by power-cycling headphones.

Outside of left transducer has __MF Multifunction__ button.
Base of right arm has (front to back) LED, covered USB-C charge
port, __`V+ Volume Up/Power__ button, __V- Volume Down__ button.

LED:
- Solid Red: charging
- Solid Blue: charging complete
- Flashing Red/Blue: pairing mode
- Flashing Blue: incoming call
- Flashes red every 2 minutes: low battery
  (Battery is about 6 hours play, up to 10 days standby.)

Pairing mode:
- From power off, hold __V+__ >5s.
  Will say, "welcome," then "pairing." Red/blue flash on LED.
- Change announcer language: double-click __MF__.
  (English → Japanese → Korean → Mandarin.)
- Reset all: Hold all three butons, __MF, V+, V-__, for 3-5 seconds until
  hear two beeps or feel vibrations.
- Also see <https://bit.ly/aftershokzpairing>

Multipoint pairing:
- Needed for two _simultaneous_ connections only? Last two (or more)
  devices paired in the regular way seem to be rememembered and connect
  fine when using just one.
- I think it does HSP profile to one device and A2DP to the other; couldn't
  play 2× A2DP at same time.
- To multipoint pair: in pairing mode, __MF,V+__ >3s, says "multipoint
  enabled." Pair, power off. Re-enter (regular) pairing mode, pair again,
  power off. Power up, says "device connected," "device 2 connected."
- Reset multipoint from power off with __V+, V-__ >3s.

Button functions (`,`=and, `/`=or):

    ringing   MF >2s      reject call           2 beeps

† Notes:
- Next/prev song mapped to skip backward/forward in my BeyondPod config.
- "Activate assistant" seems unneeded on Android phones, which always
  respond to "Hey, Google."
