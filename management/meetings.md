["The 16 Types of Business Meetings (and Why They Matter)"][luc17],

Meeting intention (purpose and desired outcomes).
- Work outcomes: determining what will be done and plans to get there.
- Human outcomes: getting agreement from everyone on the plan.

Format:
- _Strength of governing rules or rituals,_ instead of "formal" vs.
  "informal," because e.g an agile stand-up is very disciplined, but may
  feel informal to experienced participants.
- _Serendipity/surprise._ Some meetings you go into in order to find new
  things (brainstorming, get-to-know-you). In others, such as status update
  meetings, big surprises are not what people are hoping for.

Participation profile:
- What kind of reasonable assumptions can we make about how well the
  participants will work together to achieve the desired goal?
- Some meetings will need to nuture and enhance relationships between
  some/all of the participants in order to achieve the desired outcomes.
- Three ways the assumptions influence meeting type:
  - Expected audience: everybody knows one another (and already work
    together); group of people brought together to fit a need (kickoff
    meetings, etc.); two distinct groups w/us-vs-them dynamic (interviews,
    negotiations, investigations).
  - Expected leadership/particiaption styles: collaborative/conversational;
    formal; broadcast meetings that don't require participation from most
    attendees.
  - Centrality of relationships: whether team members must get along to
    achieve the objective; whether an objective is to build positive
    relationships.

The 16 general types they define are in three basic groups:
- Review, renew, refine: cadence, progress updates, action review.
- Create change, with particpants and patterns assembled to fit the need:
  idea generation, planning, workshops, problem solving, decision making.
- Evaluate/influence (meetings between "us" and "them"): sensemaking,
  introductions, issue resolution, community of practice, training,
  broadcast.

They also categorise each of these on two axes:
- Cadance, Catalyst, Learn and Influence
- Congenial, Formal, Intense

There are detailed descriptions of every meeting type in the original
article, and the groups/categories above are described in their [Periodic
table of meetings][luc17ptab], whence the following chart:
