Nix Package Manager
===================

[NixOS] is a Linux distribution that uses the [Nix] package manager and the
[Nixpkgs] channel. However, Nix itself requires neither of these and can be
used standalone on any Linux distro or MacOS.


Installation
------------

* __Debian:__ `apt-get install nix-bin` and add yourself to the `nix-users`
  group. (The `nix-setup-systemd` package for the Nix daemon will be
  included as a recommendation unless you specifically exclude it.)
* __Arch:__ `nix` and `archlinux-nix` packages available, but seems to
  require [some manual configuration][arch].
* __Vendor:__ [Binary install][nix instbin] typically via `sh <(curl -L
  https://nixos.org/nix/install) --daemon`, or [build from source][nix
  instsrc]


Overview
--------

Paths:

    /nix/store/             object store
    /nix/var/nix/profiles/  profile symlinks into /nix/store/*-environment
    ~/.nix-profile          symlink to current environment
    ~/.nix-channels         file listing channels
    ~/.nix-defexpr/         (see nix-env(1) manpage)

Most Nix package-related information outside `/nix/store/` is just symlinks
into that object store. In a "multi-user" configuration all changes to
`/nix/` are handled by the Nix daemon, which also has its own user IDs for
building things. Nix can also be used in a "single-user" configuration
where `/nix/` is owned by a user.

Nix packages are are instances of a more general object, the _derivation_,
which is anything generated by a build action (including downloaded source,
intermediate build products, profiles, channel information, etc.). These
are generated by evaluating _expressions_ in the pure, lazy, functional
[Nix expression language][nix expr]. Derivations are stored under
`/nix/store/` in files named for an SHA256 of the inputs followed by a
(human-readable) symbolic name that is used by `nix-env`.

### Environments and Profiles

An _environment_ is a directory in the store that provides a standard Unix
$PREFIX hierarchy (`bin/`, `share/`, etc.) giving a synthesized view of a
subset of packages in the whole store. This view includes filename
priority, usually determined by the order in which packages were installed,
so an environment with A then B installed is different from an environment
with B then A installed. Environments will be re-used if a sequence of
install commands produces the same environment as one that already exists.

A _profile_ is a name for a set of environments called _generations_ of
that profile, one of which is the _current generation_. The generations
have no relationship to each other; if the higest generation number is _M_:
any command that creates a new environment always assigns generation _M+1_
regardless of the current generation and `nix-env --rollback` always
switches to the highest generation less than _M_, regardless of what the
previous generation actually was. Thus, if the highest generation number is
6, switching from 5 to 3 and installing a package will take you to
generation 7, and rollback will take you to 6, not 3.

Profiles are implemented as a naming and symlinking convention. Profile
`PNAME` is a symlink to a generation `PNAME-1-link`, which in turn is a
symlink to an environment `/nix/store/...-user-environment/` which contains
the hierarchy. The _active profile_ is the one currently being operated on
(the current profile below or specified with `-p PATH`).

`~/.nix-profile` is a symlink indicating the _current profile_, which is
used when `-p PATH` is not specified. The user typically will add
`~/.nix-profile/bin/` to his $PATH.

With no current profile, profile modification commands will create a new
profile `/nix/var/nix/profiles/per-user/USER/profile` and set the current
profile to that. That directory is owned by the user but is not special
otherwise; creating and using other profiles in that directory requires
specifying the full path. (User channel information is also stored there.)


Commands
--------

### Environment Variables

The `nix.sh`
(single-user installation) and `nix-daemon.sh` (multi-user installation)
are the nix-supplied sh/bash profiles for `/etc/profile.d/`.

Enviroment variables are listed in [Chapter 21: Common Environment
Variables][nix env] and a section of the `nix-env(1)` manual page. Neither
of these are complete; ▲ below marks ones for which no documentation has
been found. ¶ marks ones set by `{nix,nix-daemon}.sh`. (`nix.sh` refers to
both unless otherwise indicated. The `nix.sh` script appears to be newer
and better written than `nix-daemon.sh`.)

- ¶`PATH`: Prefixed with `$HOME/.nix-profile/bin` by `nix.sh`.
- ¶`MANPATH`: Prefixed with `$HOME/.nix-profile/share/man` by `nix.sh` (but
  not by `nix-daemon.sh`).
- ¶`NIX_SSL_CERT_FILE`
- ▲¶`NIX_PROFILES`: Set by `nix.sh` to a space-separated list of specific
  profiles: `/nix/var/nix/profiles/default $HOME/.nix-profile`. Testing
  shows that these do not seem to be used by `nix-env`.
- ¶`NIX_PATH`: See below.

__NIX_PATH__

`profile.d/nix.sh` does:

    # Append ~/.nix-defexpr/channels to $NIX_PATH so that <nixpkgs>
    # paths work when the user has fetched the Nixpkgs channel.
    export NIX_PATH=${NIX_PATH:+$NIX_PATH:}$HOME/.nix-defexpr/channels

`profile.d/nix-daemon.sh` instead does (linebreaks for readability):

    NIX_PATH="\
      nixpkgs=/nix/var/nix/profiles/per-user/root/channels/nixpkgs\
             :/nix/var/nix/profiles/per-user/root/channels"

Not clear why the `nix-daemon` version is different. Perhaps it's because
it wants to use "system" channels by default in the multi-user
configuration, or perhaps it's just an older script that hasn't been
updated.

### Common Options

Most everything takes `--dry-run` to print what would have been done
instead of doing it. It may also print which paths are being built from
source and which are being  substituted (downloading a binary instead of
building.)

`-v`/`--verbose` and `--quiet` increase and decrease the verbosity level
with each use. The default level is 0 "Errors only"; subsequent ones are 1
"Informational," 2 "Talkative," 3 "Chatty," 4 "Debug," 5 "Vomit."

### Useful Commands

    nix-env [--dry-run] [-v] [--quiet] ...      # common options

    sudo nix-daemon --daemon &  # start daemon in docker container
    nix ping-store      # (no args) check if daemon is running and accessible
    nix-env -qa         # Query packages; -a = all (uninstalled too; slow)

    #   Nixpkgs "standard library"
    nix-channel --add https://nixos.org/channels/nixpkgs-unstable
    nix-channel --update
    nix-channel --list
    nix-env -qas        # status of packages

    nix-store --gc --print-roots
    nix-store --gc --print-live

### nix-env

    nix-env [--dry-run] [-v] [--quiet] [-p PATH] ...
    nix-env -q [-s] [SEL]               # query
    nix-env [-i|-u|-e] SEL              # install/update/erase

Takes one operation: `-q` query, `-i` install, etc. Bare arguments `SEL`
are "selectors" that are regexps. The portion of a package name after the
final hyphen is considered the version, and bare names match the latest
version of a package.

Common arguments:
* `--dry-run`: print what would be done;
  show what will be built and what will be substituted.
* `-v`, `-q`: change verbose level up/down
* `-p PATH`, `--profile PATH`: Set the _active profile_.
  The default is the _current profile_, `~/.nix-profile`.
* `-f PATH`, `--file PATH`: Sets the _active nix expression_ (dir with
  `default.nix` in it) used to obtain derivations. (default `~/.nix-defexpr`)
  May start with `http://` or `https://` to download tarball with single
  top-level dir containing `default.nix`.

Operations on a profile:
* __Query:__ `-q`, `--query`
  * : `-s` for status (`IPS`=installed in current user env, present on
    system, "substitute" available i.e. pre-built binary can be fetched)
* __Install:__ `-i`, `--install` (selector required): creates new user
  environment with this package added (even if same version already
  present—installing again my change filename conflict resolution?).
* __Upgrade__ `-u`, `--upgrade` (selector optional): Replace current
  versions of listed packages (all in env if no selector) with newer
  versions, if available.
* __Erase__: `-e` / `--uninstall` (selector required): remove a package

Profile management commands:
* `-S PATH`/`--switch-profile PATH`: Change the `~/.nix-profile` symlink to
  point to `PATH`. Non-absolute paths are relative to CWD. No validity
  checks are done.
* `--list-generations`
* `-G N`, `--switch-generation N`: Change current generation to _N_.
* `--rollback`: Switch to the highest-numbered generation less than the
  current one.
* `--delete-generations N ...`: Delete given generations. "`old`" will
  delete all non-current generations, `30d` all older than 30 days, and
  `+N` to keep the last _N_. Users must use this reguarly for GC to be
  effective.
